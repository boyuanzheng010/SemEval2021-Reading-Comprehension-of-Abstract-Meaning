He said it should be to gaming what the National Gallery is to art. The NVA was close to folding just one year after it opened. Mr Livingstone, who helped launch the Lara Croft franchise, said it was his and the gaming industry's \"duty\" to support the NVA - the only institute of its kind in the UK. He said it was only when it nearly closed that its profile was raised. \"There were people [in the industry] who didn't know about it,\" he said. \"They asked 'what is it?', 'how can we help?'\" Visitor feedback was positive, scoring an average of 4.5 out of 5 on Tripadvisor, but for a number of reasons, including funding delays, the business ran out of money. The NVA's co-director, Iain Simons, said the arcade's staff took \"deferred payment\" to keep the doors open. He also appealed to videogame developers for help with investment, with Mr Livingstone one of the people who answered the call. It was not surprising that Ian Livingstone, the co-founder of games company Games Workshop, stepped in to help the NVA. He has been a huge supporter and says the National Videogame Arcade should be to gaming what the National Gallery is to fine art. He was at its launch in March 2015 and spoke of how pervasive gaming was - everywhere you go people of all ages are playing games on smartphones, on consoles. Mr Livingstone also likes to remind people how much the games industry is worth, a cool $100bn. But he said gaming was much more than entertainment, it is a \"genuine art form\" and should be recognised as such. He said the NVA should not just be a museum but explore the \"cultural impact\" of videogames. The National Videogame Foundation will concentrate mainly on education. Mr Livingstone said it was a \"call to action\" and a \"vital moment for videogames' cultural confidence\". The foundation will deliver the GameCity Festival, held every October, and operate the arcade. Richard Wilson, CEO of TIGA, which represents the UK's games industry, said the NVA was a \"great project\" and the largest videogame developers could have a \"bigger role to play\" there.

It has now submitted plans to Mansfield District Council for its building on Berry Hill Lane to be sold for housing.

The UDM was formed in 1985 by Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire miners after a bitter split with the National Union of Mineworkers during the miners' strike. At that time it represented workers at 17 collieries. After backing down over plans to close more than 20 pits in 1981, Margaret Thatcher's government reintroduced the cuts in 1984. Locally-based actions were declared a national strike by the NUM's Arthur Scargill on 12 March. The most violent confrontation between the police and pickets was at the Orgreave coking plant in South Yorkshire in June. Running on stockpiled reserves and coal from working pits in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, power stations avoided blackouts in the winter of 1984. The strike ended on 5 March 1985 after a narrow vote at an NUM conference. But government pit closure programmes and the struggle to be profitable in the private sector has seen this reduced to just one working deep mine at Thoresby. UDM spokesman David McGarry said the slimmed down staff were \"rattling around\" the current headquarters. \"We want to move somewhere smaller, more suited to our needs, with lower running costs,\" he said.

The photographs are drawn from archives of several American newspapers that have been discarding their analogue print collections in favour of digital storage. Many are marked up with chinagraph pencil, outlining the crop required for a particular story layout in the newspaper. Some depict the fuel crisis of the early 1970s, others show accidents and some appear to be press events for the promotion of a certain model. In an interview with George Kaplan that appears at the back of the book, Campany describes how the book began. \"I came across the shot of the woman with her head in her arms at the wheel of her car. Her name was Pat Sullivan and she was waiting in line for gas in Baltimore, 1979. I thought it was such a beautiful image.

It is expected to say failings may have led to \"hundred of millions\" of euros not being realised for Irish taxpayers. The Republic of Ireland's opposition has called for the establishment of a commission of investigation into the €1.6bn (£1.36bn) transaction. Taoiseach (prime minister) Enda Kenny has pointed to legal issues concerning the ability to compel witnesses and documents as two jurisdictions are involved.

Nama has always insisted the deal was conducted with integrity, and is expected to contest the report's conclusions. The report will be published on Wednesday or Thursday. Controversy around the Northern Ireland portfolio sale has centred on the role of the businessman and former Nama advisor Frank Cushnahan. While working as an advisor to Nama, he began talking to a US investment fund, Pimco, which was interested in buying the portfolio. He then left his Nama role and went on to assist the fund with its bid. He was due to be paid £5m if the bid succeeded - but it collapsed when Nama learned of Mr Cushnahan's role. Subsequently, only two other firms made offers to buy the Northern Ireland portfolio. The highest bid of £1.24bn - a fraction above the minimum reserve price - was made by Cerberus. The other offer from Fortress was for £1.1bn, which was below the reserve. Earlier this year, the BBC's Spotlight programme broadcast a covert recording in which Mr Cushnahan claimed he was also due to be paid a fee in relation to the Cerberus deal.

The room was too low to stand up in, one victim was chained to a boiler, and the only food in the room was a container of orange juice, police said. One suspect, Linda Ann Weston, previously served eight years in prison for starving a man to death in 1981. Police officially charged Weston, 51, Gregory Thomas, 47, and Eddie Wright, 50 with multiple charges, including criminal conspiracy, kidnapping and aggravated assault.

Turgut Gozleveli, the owner of the Philadelphia building, told the Philadelphia Inquirer he checked out the basement after neighbours complained of suspicious people. When he failed to find anyone in the basement, he followed the sound of a barking dog to a room under the basement, where a chain was wrapped around a door handle.

According to police interviews with the captives, they had been brought to Philadelphia about 10 days before they were found, having been in West Palm Beach, Florida, and Texas. Linda Ann Weston and Eddie Wright recently lived for about two months at a home in West Palm Beach, stripping it of wire and plumbing and smearing faeces on the walls, according to a report by the Palm Beach Post.

It's gutting. I picked the wrong day to ski slowly.\" Musgrave, who was born in Poole, Dorset, speaks fluent Norwegian and is studying for a civil engineering degree in Trondheim, where he lives and trains.

He was swimming with fellow actress Camila Pitanga when he got dragged away by strong currents. She cried for help but local residents in the north-eastern state of Sergipe initially believed the drowning was a scene in the soap opera. But the authorities said there was nothing anyone could have done. \"They thought they had chosen a safe spot to swim but that is one of the most dangerous areas in the town of Caninde and usually avoided by locals,\" police chief Antonio Francisco Filho told O Globo. Montagner was buried in his native city of Sao Paulo. \"The show must go on and we will carry on for him,\" said Montagner's brother, Francisco. Ms Pitanga and other Globo TV actors attended the funeral, which took place at a local theatre. \"I first thought it was a rumour. It looked like they had mixed up fiction and reality,\" actress Dira Paes told the G1 website. \"We also need to be there for Camila [Pitanga],\" she added. Ms Pitanga is said to be very distressed after watching Montagner drown next to her. She said she held his hand twice as he struggled with the strong currents but could not save him. Montagner had been married for 14 years to actress Luciana Lima, with whom he had three children. His family asked fans to respect their privacy and stay away from the funeral.

Jemal - the 28-year-old centre back, who previously played in the German Bundesliga with FC Cologne and Ajaccio in the French Ligue 1 - emerged as his team's star, as Etoile won Africa's second-biggest club competition. His bundled finish in the 24th minute of Sunday's decider at the Olympic Stadium in Sousse added to his vital equaliser in the final minutes of last Saturday's first leg in Soweto, which cancelled out Thamsanqa Gabuza's strike. Jemal's second goal of the tie came after Pirates defender Happy Jele miscued a cross and the ball spun viciously back towards goal, with the centre-half managing to bundle the ball over the line.

Pirates were already familiar with Tunisian teams, beating CS Sfaxien 1-0 in a Confederation Cup group game in Sfax four months ago. But that did not help in the two-legged final, as Jemal - deputising as captain for injured goalkeeper Aymen Mathlouthi - inspired Etoile to claim a ninth African title. It is also the fifth Tunisian success in 12 finals of the African equivalent of the Europa League, with Sfaxien having triumphed a record three times. In addition, it marks Etoile's first continental title since the 2008 Super Cup as well as coach Faouzi Benzarti's third African club title.

Film of enemy planes was projected onto its walls for target practise. A museum in the restored concrete structure is now open to visitors following grants from English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund. Listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1986, plans to restore the dome at the former RAF Langham, seen at the forefront of both defence and attack during WW2, began more than 20 years go. The restoration of the 25ft (7.6m) tall and 40ft (12m) wide dome got under way in 2013 after the project secured grants of nearly Â£650,000. One of the key issues was to protect the metal grid framework on which the dome is based, said the Friends of Langham Dome. Extensive work, involving 17 tonnes of rendering sand on the shell, was also required to ensure it was watertight. Malcolm Crowder, from the North Norfolk Historic Buildings Trust, said: \"The dome was built essentially as a temporary structure over 70 years ago. \"Crumbling concrete on the outer surface had allowed water to get in, causing serious deterioration to the metal framework. This became a vicious circle of decay for both the concrete and metal structure. \"This situation has been reversed and the building... is now fit to grace the Norfolk skyline and educate the public for at least another 50 years.

The alleged thefts are thought to have started in the 1936-39 Civil War. Some cases are believed to happened as late as the 1990s. The practice is believed to have been motivated by a desire to remove children from \"undesirable\" left-wing parents and give them to \"approved\" right-wing families.

Many cases have been dismissed for lack of evidence. Clad in the habit of her Sisters of Charity order, Sister Maria was jeered as she was escorted out of court in Madrid. The mother in Sister Maria's case, Maria Luisa Torres, says the nun took away her baby girl soon after she gave birth in the Santa Cristina hospital, where Sister Maria worked.

The evacuation deal also includes government-held parts of Idlib province besieged by rebels. The UN envoy for Syria says there are plans for peace talks on 8 February. Some 7,000 people are still trapped in Aleppo, according to the Syrian Observatory. Conditions there are grim, with no access to food and shelter and minimal medical facilities. Among those evacuated on Monday were 47 children trapped in an orphanage, children's charity Unicef said in a statement. Some were in a critical condition because of injuries or dehydration, the organisation added. The evacuees also included seven-year-old Bana Alabed, whose home in eastern Aleppo was bombed and whose appeals for peace on Twitter were heard worldwide. In a video she expressed relief at escaping the \"endless bombardment in Aleppo\". After leaving Aleppo city, the evacuees will be moved to parts of Aleppo and Idlib provinces. The operation restarted late on Sunday. It had stalled after armed men set fire to buses that were about to transport the sick and injured from the mainly Shia, government-held villages of Foah and Kefraya in Idlib province. The Syrian Observatory said that 500 of the 4,000 villagers left the areas on Monday. A rebel representative said hundreds of people would also be evacuated from Zabadani and Madaya, two army-besieged rebel towns near the border with Lebanon, as part of the deal.

Since World War Two, the three worst attacks on land - excluding those targeting planes, such the 1988 Lockerbie bombing - have taken place in the past 16 years.  These are: The pattern until 2000 had been a high number of incidents with small death tolls. Eta, the Basque separatist group that is now handing in its weapons, killed more than 800 people in 3,300 attacks over 40 years - an average of just one death for every four attacks. But although the number of high-fatality attacks has dramatically gone up, annual deaths from terrorism have decreased just as dramatically. In the 1970s and 1980s the figure averaged more than 150. Since 1990, it has been about 50, although attacks in Paris and Brussels have led to a sharp spike for 2015 and 2016. The word \"terrorism\" has no universally accepted definition. The Global Terrorism Database uses three criteria. To label an act as \"terror\" it must: One may debate whether any particular attack meets all three criteria, but the broad trend is clear: the chance of a European of being killed by militants has fallen sharply over the past four decades. Throughout the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the annual risk for civilians was about one in 25,000. In France in 2015 - a particularly bloody year in that country - it was one in 400,000. In 2001, the year of the deadliest attack in the US, the likelihood of being killed by a militant in America was less than one in 100,000. Those statistics, of course, do not tell the whole story. There are notable differences between the terrorists of today and those of previous generations. In the 1970s, militants were motivated by ideology - usually a radical form of Marxism. They focused on official targets or high-profile figures embodying the capitalism. The main groups - such as Eta, France's Action Directe, Germany's Baader-Meinhof gang, or Italy's Red Brigades - had forged links and were sponsored by a superpower, the Soviet Union.

The competition attracted 50 entries, with the winners chosen by public vote and a panel of judges. One judge said the structures were \"unique and eclectic\". The Sussex Downs students worked on their design, inspired by happy times at the beach, during ceramics classes led by artist Sheila Hay. \"The idea for the hut is that it is all clad in ceramic tiles, some of which will be made by the students themselves,\" said Ms Hay. \"I am absolutely thrilled they have won. \"To win along with international architects is fantastic - I  don't know if they will appreciate the significance of that but they do know about being winners or losers.\" The students' entry won the community category in The Huts Eastbourne competition.

He was found guilty over secret \"black credit cards\" handed out to bank board members and advisers, who used them to buy luxury goods and entertainment. Miguel Blesa was given a six-year sentence but died before his appeal could be heard. Having arrived at the Puerto del Toro estate at Villanueva del Rey in the early hours of Wednesday, he had been having breakfast with a friend when Blesa said he had to move his car. Moments later a shot rang out and his body was found. Spanish authorities were investigating a possible suicide but had not ruled out the theory of an accident, sources said. Blesa was a passionate hunter and had a gun licence. For a Spain reeling from an economic crisis exacerbated by a €51bn (£45bn; $58bn) state bailout of the banks, the credit card revelations that emerged in 2013 were toxic. Caja Madrid and Bankia, the bank it became in 2010 when merged with five other savings banks, were both implicated in the scandal that ran from 1999 to 2012. The Bankia bailout cost more than €20bn. Much of the money will never be recovered. An estimated €15.5m, supposedly meant to cover the costs of attending board meetings, had been spent with the unofficial credit cards on jewellery, holidays and luxury clothes or just taken out of cash machines. Blesa was found guilty of misappropriating €436,700 of funds. Pictures emerged of the former chairman on hunting trips, showing off his spoils including a dead hippopotamus. The case ensnared more than 60 bank executives and ex-board members. Among them was Rodrigo Rato, the illustrious ex-head of the International Monetary Fund, who was handed four and a half years in jail. The case also seeped into Spanish politics as Rodrigo Rato had been a high-profile economy minister in the centre-right Popular Party government before he joined the IMF. He became chairman of Bankia in 2010 two years before it had to be bailed out.

Oscar's Wine Bar in Lancaster admitted at Preston Crown Court to failing to ensure the cocktail was safe to consume after the incident in October 2012. Charges were also dropped against barman Matthew Harding, from Lancaster. The firm's director Andrew Dunn, of Old Earswick, York, pleaded not guilty to his part in the company's failings. The court heard prosecutors would offer no evidence against him if he made a Â£20,000 payment towards court costs before the wine bar's sentencing on 17 September. The company, registered in Swinton, South Yorkshire admitted one count of failing in the duty of an employer to ensure the safety of persons not in its employment. A not guilty plea was accepted from bar employee Mr Harding, of George Street, Lancaster. It had been alleged he presented the Nitro-Jagermeister at the customer's table when it was still producing cold nitrogen gases and was unsafe to drink. Miss Scanlon, now aged 20, was celebrating her birthday with friends at Oscar's when she drank the shot. She said her stomach began to expand and a CT scan at Lancaster Royal Infirmary found a large perforation. The student spent three weeks in hospital as doctors removed her stomach and connected her oesophagus directly to her small bowel. Welcoming the guilty plea, a statement from her solicitor Patricia Noone said the family hoped the case would serve as a warning to all bars and restaurants to take \"take responsibility for what they are serving to members of the public\". It added: \"She now suffers episodes of agonising pain and has been hospitalised several times.

It credited bolder-than-expected monetary easting by the European Central Bank for the increase. For next year, the think-tank now expects growth in the euro area to be 2.1%, up from 1.7%. Other data released on Wednesday showed eurozone unemployment improving. Official figures showed the jobless rate fell to 11.1% in April, down from 11.2% the month before. Separately, an influential survey from Markit indicated eurozone companies created jobs at the fastest pace in four years last month. May was the seventh month in a row that firms in the eurozone had increased employment, Markit found. Job creation accelerated last month in Germany, France and Spain, Markit said, with job growth in Spain hitting its fastest rate for more than seven years. However, the survey also indicated that economic growth in the eurozone's private sector lost steam last month. Markit's composite purchasing managers' index (PMI) dipped to 53.6 in May from 53.9 in April.

At least 19 troops and pro-government militiamen have been killed since Monday in rebel attacks on Barzeh district, to the north of Damascus, reported the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. And in the town of Azaz on the border with Turkey, the UK-based activist group reported heavy clashes between al-Qaeda-linked fighters and Western-backed rebels on Wednesday. The clashes, between militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) and the Free Syrian Army (FSA), have erupted since ISIS forced FSA rivals out of Azaz last month. The discord - driven by claims over territory and resources as well as ideological differences - adds a new layer of complexity to the conflict which has killed over 100,000 people in two years. More than two million Syrians have fled the conflict in their country, and many more have been displaced internally. The statement agreed by the Security Council on Wednesday highlights those displaced and trapped by the \"unacceptable and escalating level of violence\" in Syria. The nearly six million of internally displaced, \"nearly half of whom are children, are in need of immediate humanitarian assistance\" without which \"their lives will be at risk\". It condemns \"widespread violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the Syrian authorities\", as well as \"any\" such violations by armed groups. And it deplores the heavy price paid by civilians caught in the conflict, saying Syrian authorities \"bear the primary responsibility to protect their populations\" - urging them to provide safe and unhindered access to populations in need of assistance.

A spokesman said troops were moving closer to the city centre. The forces, aligned to the UN-backed unity government in Tripoli, began the battle to retake the city last month. A spokesman, Ahmed Hadia, told the BBC IS forces had weakened, but \"not totally broken down\". He said the troops were encircling part of the city. Why is Libya so lawless? Life in Libya under IS Clashes centred on the Ougadougou conference centre, which was once a venue for international summits but has now become an IS command centre. Forces loyal to the government targeted the conference centre with heavy artillery fire, backed by warplanes. IS fighters responded using sniper fire, machine guns and mortar rounds. The government said two soldiers were killed and eight were wounded. The Misrata spokesman told the BBC that troops were finding fewer landmines or booby-trapped cars the deeper they moved into the city. Mr Hadia said the car bombs they were finding were smaller than the ones they had used before, \"which suggests they were hastily set up\". The troops' biggest fear, he added, was the presence of snipers and the possibility that civilians could be trapped in the battle zone. Sirte was the hometown of ousted ruler Muammar Gadaffi. The unity government was formed in Tripoli more than two months ago. The US said the unity government should be allowed to arm itself against IS. Secretary of State John Kerry has said this would be \"the only way to generate the cohesion necessary\" to defeat the militants. Officials in the capital are hoping that a victory in Sirte will narrow the political divide still plaguing the country. The anti-IS forces fighting in Sirte are largely made up of militia brigades from Libya's third largest city, Misrata. This operation started last month, initially only by the armed groups there which felt a growing threat when it appeared the extremist group was edging closer to their city. But they are also allied to the UN-backed government in Tripoli, and are now believed to be jointly-commanded by figures appointed by the government from Libya's traditional army. Although UK and US special forces are known to have been advising and possibly training forces there in recent months, it is not clear if this latest operation is getting any outside help.", "question": "Libyan forces say they have retaken @placeholder of the port in the city of Sirte , after fierce fighting with militants from so - called Islamic State .", "option_0": "evidence", "option_1": "parts", "option_2": "signs", "option_3": "control", "option_4": "criticism", "label": 3}

There were still \"issues that we don't see eye to eye on\", a US state department spokesman said. A flag will not be raised at the American Embassy in Havana until Mr Kerry pays a visit there on 14 August. Bruno Rodriguez, Cuba's minister of foreign affairs, called for a removal of the 53-year-old US trade embargo and for the US to return Guantanamo Bay to Cuba. \"I will welcome Mr Kerry in a few weeks and continue talks,\" Mr Rodriguez said. Outside of the embassy, crowds of people cheered as the Cuban national anthem played and three Cuban soldiers stood at attention while the flag was raised. Protesters dotted the crowd, and one was removed from the area by police. Mr Obama's efforts to engage Cuba were partly held back by the country's imprisonment of US Agency for International Development contractor Alan Gross, who was jailed for espionage charges. Secret negotiations led to Mr Gross's release last year. Restrictions on Americans wanting to travel to Cuba remain in place, as does the wider US trade embargo banning most American companies from doing business in Cuba.

On the back of two half-centuries in last week's win over Gloucestershire, Brown looked certain to bring up his hundred after batting for almost five hours, but was trapped lbw by Raine to a ball which appeared to keep low. However, South African Prince, who has already made three hundreds this season, maintained his fine form, striking 10 fours in his fourth half-century of the season, Leicestershire's only other high point of a tough day in the field came from former Lancashire man Andrea Agathangelou, who pulled off a stunning one-handed catch at slip to dismiss Horton off the bowling of Rob Taylor. Lancashire batsman Karl Brown: \"We've done what we set out to do and put ourselves in a great position. But there's still two days to go, and we've got to play a lot of good cricket to win this game. \"I'm obviously disappointed to be out for 96.

I'm just glad I didn't get it when I was on nought.\" Leicestershire spinner Jigar Naik: \"We were unfortunate to get bowled out for 207.

I felt we stuck at our task well, although we would have liked one or two more wickets. \"I got a long spell and beat the bat a bit, but that sort of thing happens in cricket.

Restorative justice has been used in the county since the beginning of 2011 and to date 190 offenders have been dealt with through the system. The system is only employed if the victim of the crime agrees to its use. The alternative to traditional processes of arrest and punishment is based on three principles. Insp Dominic Human said: \"You have to acknowledge that what you've done is wrong, you do some reparation to put it right, and you reintegrate into society. \"So you move on very quickly, accepting that you've been given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity not to become a criminal. \"On many occasions it's simply that a victim just wants an apology, and restorative justice allows that to happen.\" Trained officers ask victims of minor crimes to suggest appropriate punishments, and then determine whether that particular solution is fair. \"We're not judge and jury at all,\" said Insp Human. \"We are simply facilitating an opportunity for someone to immediately say: 'I've done something wrong and I want to put it right'.\" As part of the restorative project, youth offenders who caused criminal damage to a window agreed to clean all the windows on the house. A 16-year-old shoplifter who stole goods to the value of £3 had to clean 100 shopping baskets and a 12-year-old who caused £75 worth of damage to a car had to send a written apology, and the parents paid for damage.

Aerial footage showed water from the Mississippi River engulfing buildings in the evacuated town of West Alton, north of St Louis, on Tuesday. In the town of Union, about 50 miles (80km) west of St Louis, buildings were partly submerged by severe flooding from the Missouri, Meramec and Bourbeuse rivers. Coast Guard spokesman Capt Martin Malloy said the high water levels and fast currents had led them to close the section of the Mississippi near St Louis - a busy route for commercial shipping. River levels are forecast to peak on Thursday and Mr Nixon warned that the situation could get worse before it gets better. He said the National Guard would provide security in evacuated areas and direct traffic away from closed roads. \"These citizen soldiers will provide much-needed support to state and local first responders, many of whom have spent the last several days working around the clock responding to record rainfall and flooding,\" he said in a statement.

In the book, society is run by The Party which is led by a shady figure called Big Brother - and yes, that's where the phrase \"Big Brother is watching you\", as well as the name of the reality show come from. A key part of Orwell's book is the way that the Party uses simplistic slogans to warp reality, like Black is White, 2+2=5, War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength.

{"article": "Originally an innovation for television coverage of cricket, Hawk-Eye has become a trusted tool for officials in cricket, tennis and now football. When the company was launched in 2001, it had two full-time employees based in Winchester. Fast-forward to 2013 and it is now owned by Sony, has 65 full-time staff and the technology is installed in 230 stadiums worldwide. Dr Paul Hawkins came up with the idea in 1999 and after 18 months of development, the technology made its debut during Channel 4's coverage of the 2001 Ashes series. A Royal Society Television Award for technical innovation followed, and the company Hawk-Eye Innovations Ltd was established - with a focus on developing the technology for use in tennis. A year later, Hawk-Eye was used in this way for the first time during the BBC's Davis Cup coverage. It received two more TV awards for innovation in 2003 and 2004, including an Emmy. After some controversial line-calls in major tennis matches, some questioned whether the technology could be used for more than just the benefit of a TV audience. The International Tennis Federation eventually approved the use of Hawk-Eye as an aid to be used by umpires, should any judgements be disputed or too close to call. Hawk-Eye was first used in a tennis tournament in 2005, making its official Wimbledon debut in 2007. Despite being praised by many, not everyone has been in favour of the technology. Most notably, 17-time Grand Slam winner Roger Federer has said in the past that Hawk-Eye is not accurate enough and has even called for it to be scrapped.

There's been a lot of focus on languages and the cultural aspect incorporated in schools - we have the National Indigenous Television channel, characters in TV shows and movies, and more children's books too. There are even Aboriginal kids writing books for other kids and and passing on their stories. I would attribute it to advances in technology and media, and also the younger generations who are taking up their cultural awareness and sharing it more widely. There's definitely a place for indigenous representation - it goes back to people getting along and living together in a community. I wrote my book based on the relationship between my son Jack who is Aboriginal and his best friend Raf, who is white, and has spina bifida. I wanted to document this caring friendship between two boys, who are so opposite to each other. Media like this teaches kids that it's not about the colour of your skin, it's not about what you look like - it's about who you are as a person. It doesn't have to be an issue - it's only an issue if you make it into one. I think it's pretty good for indigenous children to see themselves in the media - there's a little bit of that sense of belonging, and identification. It's a good and positive thing to be able to say, 'Yep, that kid looks like me'. They can relate to it. So in terms of teaching and education that is fantastic, and a lot more is happening now. When I first saw the pictures of Johnathan Thurston and his daughter in the newspaper, I didn't really think much of it. I'm not sure why it's such a big deal. Perhaps it depends on how you've been raised and what difference means to you. I just think maybe it's because the doll is so dark? It really stands out and obviously is something his daughter treasures. And then it goes back to them perhaps at first glance not looking very indigenous, the daughter especially, and she's holding the doll.

Moore said that while he would be playing the same character they wanted to avoid \"any deliberate\" comparisons. The interview, one of a series in Empire on Bond, came ahead of new Bond film Skyfall. Starring Daniel Craig as 007 and directed by Oscar-winner Sam Mendes, the latest movie in the franchise will be released in October. Scenes have been shot in London, Turkey and the White Corries in Glencoe. The filming in the Highlands in February reportedly involved a car chase featuring Aston Martin DB5s - the same car driven by Connery in Goldfinger and Thunderball. Talking about his early discussions with Hamilton about taking over from Scottish actor Connery, Moore said: \"We talked about my approach to the character. \"The thing he wanted to avoid was any deliberate comparison to Sean, apart from the fact I was playing the same character. \"So I was never saying 'Martini, shaken not stirred'.\" In her interview with Empire, producer Barbara Broccoli recalls how Connery exploded the traditional image of a movie's leading man. Ian Fleming's books about the secret agent were adapted for film by Broccoli's father Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman. She said: \"The typical British leading man used to be Trevor Howard or Leslie Howard - very polite and your classic gentleman. \"I think the real genius of Cubby and Harry was the fact that they didn't pay any attention to the typical class structure and they took someone who was a very real person and put him into this suit.\" The magazine tells of \"unsung hero\" Yat Malmgren, a Swedish dance teacher to whom Connery turned to help hone his movement and gestures. It also tells of Dr No scriptwriter Terence Young introducing Connery to his Savile Row tailors and then telling the actor to sleep in the suits.

Dr Tom Black, Chair of BMA's Northern Ireland general Practitioners committee, said the move was unavoidable. \"In the absence of a rescue plan for General Practice, and to help address the ongoing crisis and as a response to funding cuts, we have had to take steps to withdraw some services, so that we can maintain our core service - seeing patients.\" This is fighting talk from GPs but, at this stage, there is no indication when the measures will kick in. It seems that the move is all about cutting back on administration work so there is more time for patients. Dr Tom Black said: \"Many prescriptions are requested for items such as cough bottles, mouth washes, shampoos and sun creams all of which are available over the counter for a small charge. \"By no longer providing prescriptions for these items, it will free up a lot of time at practices and would make phone lines more accessible and means a GP has more time to see patients.\" The Northern Ireland General Practice Committee has called for three measures \"to prevent the collapse of general practice across the country'.

The Daily Telegraph claims there are plans for First Minister Alex Salmond's head to feature on Scottish pound coins, replacing the Queen in an independent Scotland. For lovers of the anagram, the story is bylined Flora Poli. Over at the Guardian, there is a story saying that Scotland is to switch to driving on the right if independence is given the green light. The paper's elaborate hoax claims there are ambitious plans to scrap the current - English inspired - road signage system. \"M for motorway will be replaced with a new S - for Scotland and the A trunk roads will become N roads - for Nationalist in honour of the new country,\" it says. The new font to be used on the signs will be a specially-developed typeface named Proclaimer, it says. The Independent has a story claiming \"Peacekeeping plans are being drawn up by United Nations in the event of a Scottish Yes vote\". Senior UN officials in New York and Geneva are understood to have begun exploring a \"last resort\" intervention following the refusal of the main Westminster parties to share the pound with an independent Scotland. The paper claims one scenario being taken seriously is pre-arranged \"face-offs\", modelled on the film Braveheart, between rival militias who it is feared could travel to towns such as Gretna Green and Berwick-upon-Tweed for weekend showdowns. The Daily Mail says it has snapped a ministerial aide accidentally revealing the design for a \"Scot-free Union Jack\", minus the blue of the saltire.

{"article": "The rare weather phenomenon of temperature inversion could trap the plant's emissions over Cwmfelinfach, an Aneurin Bevan health board boss said. Residents raised the issue before Caerphilly council approved the plans in December. The firm involved said emissions would have a \"negligible\" impact. Dr Gillian Richardson, executive director of public health at Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, has written to officials at Natural Resources Wales (NRW) recommending they \"exercise caution\" when considering granting the plant a permit. The environmental body is consulting on whether to approve the development. Temperature inversion is where cold air is trapped in a valley by warm air above, preventing clouds and smog from escaping. Residents opposing the development have argued it could also trap emissions. The health board said temperature inversion was not taken into account in the original air quality assessment. It recognised that any emissions would be within legal limits. But Dr Richardson said new data showed the development would cause \"significant short-term local air quality deterioration within an area of deprivation, including vulnerable populations\". She claimed \"there is no known safe threshold of exposure\" to an emission like nitrogen dioxide, which can irritate lungs and lower resistance to respiratory infections, such as influenza.

{"article": "Edi Rama's historic trip to Belgrade was seen as an attempt to put differences aside after a football international was abandoned last month. But tempers flared when Mr Rama said Kosovo's independence was \"undeniable\" and \"must be respected\". Serbian PM Aleksandar Vucic hit back accusing him of a \"provocation\". Kosovo, a former Serbian province with an ethnic Albanian majority, unilaterally declared independence in 2008. Although many European nations and the US have recognised its independence, dozens of other countries do not, along with Serbia and the thousands of ethnic Serbs in Kosovo itself. Simmering resentment between Albania and Serbia spilled over at last month's Euro 2016 qualifier in Belgrade. Play was halted before half time when a drone appeared above the pitch, carrying an Albanian flag and a map of \"greater Albania\" showing nationalist claims on neighbouring states, including Serbia. A Serbia player pulled down the flag and a brawl ensued during which several Albanian players were attacked by fans. The Albanian prime minister was caught up in last month's row when Serbian media accused his brother of controlling the drone from the stadium's stands. Mr Rama's visit had already been postponed because of the anger surrounding the match on both sides. Then a news conference on Monday with his Serbian counterpart descended into both leaders trading barbs. While both countries had completely different positions, Mr Rama said, the reality was \"one and unchangeable\". \"Independent Kosovo is an undeniable regional and European reality, and it must be respected,\" he insisted, provoking an angry response from Mr Vucic. \"I did not expect this provocation,'' the Serbian PM said. \"What does Albania have to do with Kosovo? Kosovo is not part of Albania and it will never be.'' The exchange continued with Mr Vucic saying that nobody would humiliate Serbia and Mr Rama denying that his remarks were provocative. The sooner Kosovo was recognised \"the faster we can move on,\" the Albanian leader said. Diplomats had tried to patch up relations after last month's brawl and Serbian radio station B92 reported that Mr Rama had spoken ahead of his trip of a new beginning for the Balkans.

{"article": "Tests on groups of obese and healthy-weight people found that the obese women performed worst when asked to remember a sequence of food picture cards. Writing in Current Biology, Yale researchers tested 135 men and women. The findings could lead to new ways to tackle obesity, the study says. Study author Ifat Levy, assistant professor at Yale School of Medicine, said the difference in the performance of the obese women compared with the other groups was \"really striking\" and \"significant\". The tests looked at an individual's ability to learn and predict the appearance of pictures of food or money on coloured cards. The participants were told they would be given whatever appeared on these \"reward\" cards. In the first phase, the reward cards always followed a particular coloured card in a sequence. Later, the order was changed and the reward cards appeared following a different coloured card. During this time, participants were asked to predict the likelihood of a reward card appearing as the cards were shown one by one. The results showed that obese women performed worst because they overestimated how often the pictures of food, including pretzels or chocolate, appeared. Even after researchers had accounted for other factors, there was still a large difference in their learning performance. Prof Levy said: \"This is not a general learning impairment, as obese women had no problem learning when the reward was money rather than food. \"An intriguing possibility is that, by modifying flawed association between food and environmental cues, we may be able to change eating patterns.\" The study said it was not clear what lay behind the learning deficit in obese women. In contrast, obese men did not show any signs of a food learning impairment. The study suggested that women who are obese act this way because of particular concerns about food or because they feel more unhappy or dissatisfied about their body image. Previous research suggests that there are differences in how men and women perceive obesity. Future research is likely to focus on whether the food-specific learning problem is a result of obesity or a potential factor in causing obesity by testing individuals before and after weight loss. The Yale researchers said their results called for a shift in focus. \"Rather than target these individuals' behaviour with food, we suggest that a successful intervention should aim to modify their interactions with other cues that determine their eating patterns,\" they wrote.", "question": "Obese women may have a \" food learning impairment \" that could explain their @placeholder to food , research from Yale School of Medicine suggests .", "option_0": "chances", "option_1": "lives", "option_2": "attitude", "option_3": "ability", "option_4": "legitimacy", "label": 2}

{"article": "One of Afghanistan's largest cities, it has long been a strategically important transport hub for the north of the country. Kunduz is linked by highways to Kabul in the south, with Mazar-e-Sharif in the west and with Tajikistan in the north. But it has always held symbolic significance for the Taliban because it was a key northern stronghold before 2001. Kunduz is considered a gateway to Afghanistan's northern provinces and shares a border with Tajikistan, Afghanistan's Central Asian neighbour. The border with Tajikistan is porous, and it is used for the smuggling of Afghan opium and heroin to Central Asia, which finally finds its way to Europe. Any side controlling Kunduz would not only influence the surrounding areas, but could also control one of the most important drug smuggling routes in the region. Security for the region - which was a flagship project for the German army - was transferred to Afghan forces in 2013. But Kunduz has many other problems: bad governance as well as incompetence and intimidation by some local officials have alienated many in the province. It has long been at the frontline of a determined campaign by the Taliban to reclaim it. In May last year the BBC's David Loyn reported from there as fighting between government forces and the Taliban unfolded. The Taliban already control huge chunks of the province's rural areas, where the majority of the population lives. The insurgents have intensified their fighting in the province over the past two years. A BBC reporter visited the city after it was back in government hands following its September 2015 capture. He found shock, a jail emptied of prisoners and many residents fearful of a Taliban return. The battle for the city saw one of the worst incidents in the recent Afghan war when a Medecins sans Frontieres hospital was hit by a US air strike. The city is  estimated to have about 300,000 residents but those numbers are likely to be fluid because fighting has prompted many to flee the city. Tens of thousands of people were displaced, living in shelters, spread across large tracts of countryside. Although the insurgents were pushed back, they always had numbers in the region and many observers believed it was only a matter of time before a determined assault was attempted.

Ahead of Friday's vote, the main opposition party Unita had called for a delay, expressing concern about a lack of transparency.

With 90% of ballots counted, the electoral authorities said the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) has won 73% of the vote, with Unita garnering 18%. A newly founded third party, Casa, is forecast to win 6%. If confirmed, the results mean another term for President dos Santos, 70, who has ruled since 1979. Final results are expected to be announced on Monday. The state-ruin newspaper Jornal de Angola has already declared Mr Dos Santos the victor, saying on its front page on Sunday: \"The MPLA is the big winner of the general elections of 2012...

He pointed to findings that fewer than 5% of Welsh people read Welsh papers. The assembly could play a part in supporting services such as blogs and hyperlocal websites, he added. \"Welsh people simply don't hear anything about Wales or Welsh politics,\" Dr Evans wrote in an article for the Open Democracy website. \"The general lack of coverage about the Welsh assembly or Welsh policy distinctiveness has led to a farcical situation whereby no one knows who does what, who is in charge of what, and so on. \"In my own field of education research, for example, teachers have told me how they are frequently confronted by upset parents scared about changes to education, unaware that the changes they have seen on the news only apply to England. \"This lack of information directly contributes to political disengagement and the uniquely low election turnout in Wales, as well as undermining the Assembly and devolution itself.\" Dr Evans said the lack of a \"truly national\" Welsh newspaper led people to rely more heavily on the BBC. However, he claimed that spending cuts on English language programming meant the corporation was \"failing to accurately represent Wales\". As far as the solutions go, Dr Evans told BBC Wales he would like to see more \"non-statist\" media emerge, like the Wings over Scotland and Bella Caledonia blogs in Scotland and Welsh examples such as the Jac o' the North blog and the Grangetown community website in Cardiff.

Retailers have blamed poor weather in Spain and Italy for limiting stocks of some vegetables, including courgettes and spinach. In the House of Lords, Baroness Jones said of environment minister Lord Gardiner of Kimble: \"He will have seen the news reports of vegetable shelves in supermarkets, with the crisis expected to last until the spring. \"And, meanwhile, prices have trebled in part because it costs more to fly vegetables from the USA and Egypt than it does to bring them overland from Spain.\" In his critique of Baroness Jones's comments, Lord Tebbit, a former chairman of the Conservative Party, narrowed his focus to a particular vegetable. He asked peers: \"Might any rational man or woman think that to describe a shortage of lettuces in a supermarket as a 'crisis' shows a lack of understanding of the meaning of the word in the English language?\" In response, Lord Gardiner said: \"I was seeking to be courteous to the baroness, but it's certainly not a crisis.

A social media campaign against use of the beef led to heightened public concerns over its health and safety. Federal regulators said the beef ingredient met food safety standards, but critics argued the food was unappetising and possibly unsafe. The US Department of Agriculture eventually chose to allow schools to stop serving the product. Lean finely textured beef is made from beef  heated and spun in a centrifuge to separate the meat from the fat, before the final product is treated with a puff of ammonium hydroxide gas to kill any bacteria. Mr Smith, formerly senior counsel and director of Environmental, Health and Safety at Beef Products Inc, filed his lawsuit in Dakota County District Court, Nebraska. The filing names Jamie Oliver, food blogger Bettina Siegel, ABC News, its journalists Diane Sawyer and Jim Avila and 10 other unnamed defendants. The company \"and its employees were unfairly and unnecessarily maligned and accused of producing a food product that did not exist, a product that critics unfairly labelled 'pink slime',\" Mr Smith said in a statement.

Eulogio Del Pino, the Venezuelan minister, who recently visited Russia and Saudi Arabia as part of a global tour to drum up support among both Opec and non-Opec producers, said \"we're on a very, very, very good path\" to reducing production. Brent crude closed up $3.30 at $33.36 a barrel in New York after falling below $30 on Thursday. After sinking to a 12-year low of $26.05 on Thursday, US crude settled up 12%, or $3.23, to $29.44 a barrel - its biggest one-day rise since 2009. Many traders were sceptical about the Journal's report, pointing out that Venezuela and Russia had tried in vain earlier this week to stir Saudi Arabia and other major producers into agreeing to output cuts. However, some believe that prices would rebound sooner or later if production tightened or demand rose. Commerzbank analysts said: \"We expect declining US oil production, in particular, to drive the oil price back up to $50 per barrel by the end of the year.\" Some traders still expected wilder price swings in the coming weeks. \"It's not a one-way price movement anymore\" in oil, said ABN Amro's senior energy economist Hans van Cleef. \"We will see a period of high volatility\".

This is just one of a number of options being considered, I'm told. Last week another possibility emerged - a so-called \"emergency brake\" mechanism which would allow a country to stop migration after it reached a certain level. This has never previously been used to stop immigration and EU officials are fond of pointing out that at the same time as immigration levels to the UK are high unemployment levels are much lower than other EU countries - suggesting, they argue, that there is no evidence that immigrants take the jobs of UK workers. Several countries - German, Austria and the Netherlands - have already agreed to the desirability of limiting benefit payments to the families of migrants and changing the so-called transitional arrangements which apply when countries join the EU. However, as yet, there is no sign of any other country wanting limits to the total numbers allowed to move from one EU country to another. There is some frustration amongst the prime minister's advisers that ideas are leaking out before they have had proper time to assess them.

Some art works also depict the decades-old conflict in the state. Kashmir is a disputed territory with both India and Pakistan claiming it in its entirety. A violent insurgency against Indian rule in Kashmir began in the late 1980s and though it has become less intense in recent years, the causes of the conflict are still far from resolved. India continues to deploy around 400,000 security personnel in Kashmir to maintain peace - a cause for resentment among many local people. In the above artwork, the boundaries of Kashmir are depicted by barbed wires. The students said their drawings were not political, but the meaning of their work was open for interpretation. Some of the creations also display Kashmir's cuisine, culture and wildlife.

{"article": "Researchers found that heavy drinkers from deprived areas are at a greater risk of dying or becoming ill due to alcohol consumption. Lead author Dr Vittal Katikireddi said it suggests that poverty may reduce resilience to disease. The University of Glasgow study is published in The Lancet journal. Its authors found a \"marked link\" between socioeconomic status and the harm caused by drinking excessively. Compared with light drinkers in advantaged areas, excessive drinkers were seven times at risk of an increase in alcohol harm. This contrasted with excessive drinkers in deprived areas, who were 11 times at risk of an increase. Harmful impacts of alcohol are higher in socio-economically disadvantaged communities. However, until now it was unclear whether those were as a result of differences in drinking or as a result of other factors. Dr Katikireddi said: \"Our study finds that the poorest in society are at greater risk of alcohol's harmful impacts on health, but this is not because they are drinking more or more often binge drinking. \"Experiencing poverty may impact on health, not only through leading an unhealthy lifestyle but also as a direct consequence of poor material circumstances and psychosocial stresses. \"Poverty may therefore reduce resilience to disease, predisposing people to greater health harms of alcohol.\" The study looked at information from the Scottish Health Surveys and electronic health records, studying more than 50,000 people. It defined harm from alcohol consumption based on deaths, hospitalisations and prescriptions that were attributable to alcohol. And it suggested that even when other factors are accounted for, including smoking and obesity, living in deprived areas were consistently associated with higher alcohol-related health problems. Co-author Dr Elise Whitley, said: \"Heavier drinking is associated with greater alcohol-related harm in all individuals. \"However, our study suggests that the harm is greater in those living in poorer areas or who have a lower income, fewer qualifications, or a manual occupation.\" Dave Roberts, director general of the Alcohol Information Partnership, said: \"We know from official government statistics that the vast majority of people consume alcohol within the Chief Medical Officer's low-risk guidelines. \"The report shows that while consuming the least amount of alcohol, the poorest may suffer disproportionate levels of harm. \"It is therefore important to understand how alcohol interacts with other issues associated with lower socio-economic status. \"This will enable a sophisticated response that targets particular communities rather than heavy-handed interventions aimed at the whole population.\"", "question": "The poorest in society are more likely to suffer the health @placeholder of excessive drinking , according to a new study .", "option_0": "effects", "option_1": "repercussions", "option_2": "generation", "option_3": "loss", "option_4": "version", "label": 1}

Ireland have participated in all six ICC Intercontinental Cup since its inception in 2004, winning it on four occasions - 2005, 2006-7, 2007-8 and 2011-13. In all, the Irish has played 32 matches, winning 20, losing just two and drawing 10. Former New Zealand off-spinner Bracewell explained that the added incentive offered by the competition made it \"incredibly exciting for the team and the country as we look to write new chapters in our cricketing history\". \"The team has a fantastic record in the competition having won it four times and we'd like nothing better than to make it five wins. \"We've selected a very strong squad for the game and are at full strength. We've got a lot of experienced players in our ranks who've played a lot of multi-day cricket.\" Among those selected is Tim Murtagh, who proved his fitness in a 2nd XI game for Middlesex last week and will take his place in an Ireland line-up for the first time in 13 months.", "question": "Ireland will begin their bid to secure Test @placeholder when they take on the United Arab Emirates in their opening Intercontinental Cup match at Malahide .", "option_0": "results", "option_1": "action", "option_2": "momentum", "option_3": "title", "option_4": "status", "label": 4}
{"article": "Panic withdrawals on Wednesday, caused by \"inaccurate\" rumours on social media, led to a run on Chase Bank, said the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). Its branches were shut on Thursday. The bank is the third to be placed under the CBK's control in the past year. Chase had recently released two conflicting financial statements, a BBC reporter says. A subsequent audit showed it had hidden loans to its directors, adds the BBC's Ferdinand Omondi in the capital, Nairobi. In a statement, the CBK said it would appoint a team to run the bank. The team would be given 12 months to come up with an \"appropriate resolution strategy\", said a CBK statement. One depositor told the BBC that he had $100,000 (Â£70,000) at Chase, and he had no idea whether he would get the money back. Hundreds of customers flocked to Chase branches and ATM machines countrywide to withdraw their cash on Thursday, only to find them closed, our reporter says. All 62 of its branches would remain closed until new management was put in place, said CBK chief Patrick Ngugi Njoroge. He insisted that the banking sector in Kenya, East Africa's biggest economy, was stable, despite the banks going into receivership. Chase is a mid-sized bank with a mixture of low- and middle-income customers, as well as wealthy businessmen who trade with firms in the Middle East. It also has a unit which specialises in Islamic finance. On Wednesday, Chase dismissed its chairman and group managing director following the release of two conflicting financial statements. One of them had downplayed the bank's internal loans, says our correspondent. An audit later showed the bank had loaned its directors $80m, and its bad debts had skyrocketed to $100m. The bank posted a profit of $23m in 2014, only to record a loss of $7m the following year. The African Development Bank, which last week agreed to lend Chase $50m for onward lending but had not disbursed the funds, said the receivership would not stop it from supporting the sector. \"The African Development Bank remains confident about the stability of the financial sector in Kenya,\" its regional boss for East Africa, Gabriel Negatu, told Reuters news agency.", "question": "A retail bank in Kenya has been placed under receivership after running into financial @placeholder .", "option_0": "failure", "option_1": "services", "option_2": "approval", "option_3": "difficulties", "option_4": "elsewhere", "label": 3}

It is claimed Mr Jiang murdered the 36-year-old and dumped his body near a remote Derbyshire lay-by so he could use Mr Liu's funds to repay gambling debts of £273,115. Mr Jiang, 43, denies murder. The court was told the Chinese men were friends, but while Mr Liu was \"comfortably off\" in a Salford Quays apartment, Mr Jiang was living in a one-bedroom flat in Beswick and being chased by creditors. The jury heard that after dismembering Mr Liu and leaving his torso in a suitcase near the A628 Woodhead Pass at Tintwistle, Mr Jiang returned to Manchester, withdrew £800 from his friend's account and went gambling. Mr Liu's remains were found by walkers on 10 October, some days after it is believed he was killed. A subsequent police search of Mr Jiang's home found an \"extensive clean-up\", prosecutor Peter Wright QC said. The court heard officers found a bloody palm print on a box in the flat and Mr Liu's blood in the bathroom. Mr Wright said following his arrest, the 43-year-old used an \"elaborate smokescreen\" of \"slurs\", including suggesting Mr Liu was a paid escort for older Chinese men, to conceal his guilt. He told the court Mr Jiang used Mr Liu's bank and credit cards, reclaimed watches worth £16,000 from pawnbrokers, and took his friend's passport to try and achieve a \"quick sale\" of the quayside apartment.

The pair had previously been in jail in China for criticising the communist government. Both were in detention in Thailand for illegally entering the country. The UN Refugee Agency said: \"This action by Thailand is clearly a serious disappointment and underscores the long-standing gap in Thai domestic law concerning ensuring appropriate treatment of persons with international protection need.\" According to the rights group Amnesty International, Mr Jiang was detained for two brief periods in 2008 after complaining about the official response to the earthquake in Sichuan province that year. He fled to Thailand shortly afterwards with his wife. Mr Dong was released in February this year after spending 10 months in jail in China for taking part in an event to remember people killed following protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989. He arrived in Thailand with his wife and daughter in September. Both Chinese dissidents, who were due to be settled in a third country by the UN, were recently fined for breaking Thai immigration rules. Amnesty International said that while the two were in jail and waiting to be resettled abroad, their fines were paid by someone not known to either man. It appears they were then transferred to an immigration detention centre before being deported over the weekend. Amnesty believes the two men have been returned to China and are \"at risk of torture and other ill treatment\". Three other people are thought to have been deported with the two dissidents. There is speculation that one of them is Hong Kong-based publisher Gui Minhai, who has not been heard from since arriving last month in the Thai resort of Pattaya, where he owns a holiday home. Mr Gui had published books that were critical of the Chinese government. Thailand faced criticism earlier this year when it sent back to China more than 100 Uighur Muslims, who had been detained as part of a larger group the previous year.

They hope the studies will help witnesses recall details more accurately when questioned by police. They say establishing a rapport with the person asking the questions can also help boost memory.

In the first, they asked volunteers to watch a film showing an electrician entering a property, carrying out work and then stealing a number of items. Volunteers were then questioned in one of four groups. People were either asked questions with their eyes open or closed, and after a sense of rapport had been built with the interviewer or no attempt had been made to create a friendly introduction. People who had some rapport with their interviewer and had their eyes shut throughout questioning answered three-quarters of the 17 questions correctly.

Initially they were said to include sniper Charles Whitman's brain and students were blamed for the \"theft\". But the formaldehyde-filled jars were actually disposed of some time ago. They were in poor condition and not suitable for research, officials said. \"We believe the workers disposed of between 40 and 60 jars, some of which contained multiple human brains, and worked with a biological waste contractor to do so safely,\" according to a university statement. \"We have no evidence at this time that any of the brain specimens came from Charles Whitman, though we will continue to investigate those reports.\" Tim Schallert, psychology professor and co-curator of the collection, initially told the Austin American-Statesman \"we think somebody may have taken the brains, but we don't know at all for sure\". The specimens were among a batch sent from the Austin State Hospital to the university nearly 30 years ago for safe keeping. The university's agreement with the hospital required the removal of any data identifying the brain's original owner. Kept in the school's basement, the brains went missing sometime in the intervening years.

The annual literary event began on Thursday with increased security. Fry was delivering one of the Festival's Reformations lectures - one of a series of special lectures inspired by the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther's Protestant reformation. \"Whether it is winter that is coming, or a new spring, it is entirely in our hands so long as we prepare,\" he told the crowd in Hay-on-Wye. \"While it's hard to calculate the cascade upon cascade of new developments and their positive effects, we already know the dire consequences and frightening scenarios that threaten to engulf us,\" he said. Science fiction writers and dystopians have already laid out the \"nightmare\" consequences, he added. Fry went on to say a \"great transformation in human society\" was under way, greater than both the printing press and industrial revolutions. It was \"the greatest change to our way of living since we moved from hunting and gathering to settling down in farms, villages and sea ports and started to trade and form civilisations\", he added. \"Whether it will alter the behaviour, cognition and identity of the individual in the same way that it is certain to alter the behaviour, cognition and identity of the group, is a hard question to answer. \"But believe me when I say that it is happening. To be frank, it has happened.\" The \"war chests\" of technology entrepreneurs were helping to fund the rapid development of artificial intelligence and robotics, he said. Mr Fry revealed to the audience that he has an internet-connected fridge at his home in Los Angeles that allows him to check its contents via his mobile phone. He also said he owned an automated car that allowed him to read a book or watch television as the car drove itself along California's freeways.

The Royal College of Nursing said it was placing pressure on GP surgeries and emergency departments. The Welsh Government said overall, the total number of nurses providing community services had increased. District nurses are senior, experienced nurses sometimes compared to being the GPs of nursing and clinically supervise less experienced staff or those with fewer qualifications, such as health care workers. The Welsh Government figures showed that in six of the seven health boards in Wales, the number of district nurses has fallen between 2009 and 2015. Only staffing at Aneurin Bevan University Health Board remained at the same level it was six years ago. The RCN said it wanted more information gathered about outcomes for people being nursed at home instead of in hospital. It said it was concerned the move to look after more people at home could have affected the care people receive. In hospitals, outcomes are measured - such as with waiting lists -  but there are less ways to judge nursing care received at home, it added. Tina Donnelly, director of the RCN in Wales, said it has \"undoubtedly\" contributed to to GP waiting times and possibly re-admissions to hospitals, as more care is given in the community. She also claimed district nurses have seen a big increase in their caseloads over the past few years, from around 30 patients to 150. \"That beggars belief in terms of the absolute contact time that nurse will be able to spend with that patient,\" she said.

{"article": "Some patients with damaged spinal cords need ventilators as they are unable to breathe on their own. A report in the journal Nature showed a nerve graft, coupled with a protein, could restore breathing. Human trials could begin soon, which the charity Spinal Research said could be \"potentially life-changing\". Damage at the top of the spinal cord, around the neck, can interrupt messages to the diaphragm - a layer of muscle involved in breathing. The cord is notoriously resistant to repair. Techniques such as nerve grafts, which worked in the arms and legs, had shown limited success with the spinal cord, doctors at the Case Western Reserve University said. The spinal cord scars after it is damaged, and molecules - chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans - prevent nerves repairing and forming new connections. Source: Spinal Research The researchers used a nerve graft to form a bridge across the scar at the same time as injecting an enzyme - chondoitinase ABC - which attacked the inhibitory molecules. Three months later, tests showed the mice had recovered 80-100% of breathing function. Professor of neuroscience and lead researcher Jerry Silver said: \"The use of the enzyme, that's helped get the nerve fibres out and we were amazed at, once they get out, how well they can reconnect. \"The spinal cord can just figure things out and restore really beautiful functional breathing patterns.\" Researchers hope to begin trials in humans. They are also investigating whether bladder function can be restored, which can be lost when the lower spine is damaged. Dr Mark Bacon, from the charity Spinal Research, said: \"Long distance regeneration has remained quite elusive in the field of spinal cord injury repair, so to achieve this and at the end of it establish functional connections that actually do something useful - restore breathing - is remarkable. \"It is potentially life-changing if this or similar techniques can be translated to the clinic.\"", "question": "The @placeholder to breathe has been restored to mice with spinal cord injuries , in what US researchers describe as a medical first .", "option_0": "public", "option_1": "body", "option_2": "response", "option_3": "ability", "option_4": "chance", "label": 3}

A UK government spokeswoman said: \"We want all the parts of our United Kingdom to work together, with better inter-governmental relations between the UK government and the devolved governments. \"We are delivering on our commitments to give more power and responsibility for the Scottish Parliament, within a strong United Kingdom. \"This is a simple issue of fairness within the UK, that makes sure that representatives from each nation are able to have a say on legislation that is specific to them.\"", "question": "Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said he believes the next 12 months could determine the long - term @placeholder of the union between England and Scotland .", "option_0": "version", "option_1": "control", "option_2": "fate", "option_3": "future", "option_4": "loss", "label": 2}

They say they want answers about what happened to the students before elections are held.

{"article": "Mention Brexit, and the party has the luxury of being entirely at one. I say luxury because, having been to both the UK Conservative and Labour conferences, harmony on a Brexit policy can be difficult to come by. The message time and again from the conference floor has been to warn of the dangers for the Welsh economy of leaving the single market. Their health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth had a particularly snappy line when he said the people of Wales voted to leave, but they didn't vote to take leave of their senses. He said the hard Brexiteers should not be allowed to have the last laugh on Wales' future, while the Arfon MP Hywel Williams accused the hard Brexiteers - by which I'm assuming he means those who want to leave the single market - of being unpatriotic. All strong stuff. One of the key points about retaining membership of the single market is that it would make it more difficult to bring in controls over EU migration. In a way it has become the policy embodiment of those who believe trade with the rest of the EU should have a higher priority than control of borders. Plaid's stance puts it at odds with Theresa May and First Minister Carwyn Jones who believe the referendum result was, above all, a message to politicians that something needs to be done about immigration. Leanne Wood and others are trying to change that narrative by saying the referendum campaign was about immigration, but it was about many other things as well such as austerity, and false claims about extra spending on the NHS. The big challenge for the party is that so many people in Wales voted to leave the EU, and they must have done so knowing full well that it would have entailed leaving the single market. Plaid insists strongly that it is not in denial about the result, but it is an accusation that is going to come its way over its position on Brexit.", "question": "Speak to Plaid members in Llangollen at their autumn conference about the departure of the former leader Lord Dafydd Elis - Thomas and Plaid Labour @placeholder at the assembly and you are likely to get different views .", "option_0": "relations", "option_1": "uncertainty", "option_2": "powers", "option_3": "benefits", "option_4": "services", "label": 0}

In 2014, Freedom House said \"the Karimov regime has all but eradicated free media in Uzbekistan. The few independent journalists who remain are subjected to harassment and detention.\" Human Rights Watch says at least three dozen journalists, activists, writers, and intellectuals are behind bars because of their work. TV is the most popular medium. Private TV and radio stations operate alongside state broadcasters. Foreign channels are carried via cable TV, which is widely available. In early 2014, digital TV penetration was 45 per cent. The President's daughter, Gulnara Karimova, was one of the major players in non-state media, but in 2013 the authorities shut down several TV and radio stations associated with her after she fell from grace in an apparent power struggle. Uzbekistan has 687 newspapers, according to the Agency for the Press and Information. These include national dailies run by the executive and parliament, and titles published by the four official political parties, but no opposition newspapers are published. Uzbekistan has almost 12 million internet users (internetlivestats). Strict online censorship includes filtering at a central level. Targets include opposition and news websites. Many Uzbeks, especially young people, use Russian social media platforms, such as VKontakte and Odnoklassniki - the latter had 7 million registered Uzbek users by 2013.

The bank said that the deal was progressing to plan and was \"on track\" to be completed by September. The Co-op Bank was rescued from the brink of collapse by a group of hedge funds in 2013, after bad property loans contributed to a £1.5bn hole in its finances.

{"article": "As a consequence of climate change, the red knot may have a lower survival chance on a different continent, say scientists. The shore bird breeds in the Arctic in the summer and flies to tropical habitats in winter. Scientists believe shrinkage in body size is a response to climate change in different animals. The latest research, published in the journal, Science, looked at the red knot (Calidris canutus). The wading bird is one of the record-breakers for long distance flight, being able to cover about 5,000 km without stopping. An international team studied the bird over 30 years at its stop-off point in Russia. \"We see a change in body size and also a change in body shape,\" said lead researcher Dr Jan van Gils of the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research and Utrecht University. He told the BBC's Science in Action programme: \"What is peculiar about this is that we have strong evidence that this is an effect of climate change and people have seen in other species changes in body size in response to climate change.\" The study was the first to show that shrinking in response to climate change was a disadvantage to an animal, because the smaller birds had a lower survival rate, he added. The scientists found that over the course of 30 years, the date of the snow melt in the Arctic had advanced by more than two weeks. Meanwhile, the birds produced smaller and smaller offspring - probably because the chicks missed the main food supply at the time of the thaw. The birds pay the price when they arrive in Africa after their long flight. Analysis of the diet of the red knot in its winter home found that individuals with a longer bill could delve into the mud for molluscs. However, those with a shorter bill could not reach the shellfish, and were forced to eat less nutritious food. \"There are only a few birds nowadays that make it to adulthood - those are the ones that are small and have a relatively long bill,\" Dr van Gils explained. The study shows that long-term changes in the body architecture of Arctic wading birds can affect their survival in their tropical wintering range, said Martin Wikelski of the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany. \"Thus, changes in one habitat may have important ecological consequences in habitats halfway around the world,\" he said in an editorial in Science.

Picasso's designs were sandblasted onto the concrete both outside and inside the buildings by the Norwegian artist Carl Nesjar. Both buildings were damaged when Breivik set off a van bomb at the foot of H block in July 2011. It was the start of a series of attacks that left 77 dead, mostly teenagers on the island of Utoeya.

Greek MPs have to approve reforms that include VAT rises and the latest overhaul of the pension system. This will be the first domestic test for Mr Tsipras since bringing back an agreement from the euro area summit that many members of his own Syriza party are referring to as a \"humiliation\" that turns Greece into a European \"protectorate\". Dozens of Syriza MPs are likely to refuse to support this first batch of legislation, leaving Alexis Tsipras's government seriously -  but perhaps not fatally - wounded. It is expected that the prime minister will reshuffle his cabinet after the vote to remove ministers who do not support the agreement struck on Monday morning. The rebellion is likely to leave him in charge of a minority government. His coalition currently has 162 of the 300 seats in Parliament and looks certain to drop well below 150 after Wednesday. The Independent Greeks party, the junior partners in the coalition, say they may oppose some measures but do not seem intent on quitting the government. The game changer is that three opposition parties (New Democracy, To Potami (The River) and Pasok) have pledged to support the measures. Early on Saturday, Mr Tsipras gained 251 votes authorising him to seal an agreement with creditors, so he has some room to manoeuvre domestically as long as the opposition backs him. The rival parties do not want to enter a coalition government at this point as they believe Mr Tsipras should take the responsibility for leading negotiations with eurozone lenders to this point.

Lana Skeldon failed to convert, and Spain soon reclaimed the lead, with neat handling and looping support lines from the back-row forwards culminating in Garcia diving in down the right, the fly-half unable to convert her own try. Chloe Rollie almost levelled for Scotland before the break, when the full-back charged-down her opposite number, Barbara Pla in the Spanish 22, but her hack-through bobbled out of play off the corner flag. A piece of predatory play from Law did haul the Scots back on terms five minutes after half-time. The ball lay static at the base of a ruck just inside the Spanish in-goal area, meaning there could be no offside, and the scrum-half dived through the bodies to press it to ground. The decisive try was scored by centre Bravo, who powered over from a quick-tap penalty in the Scottish 22, carrying there tacklers with her, Garcia once more wayward from the tee.

{"article": "But a new analysis from the government shows a majority of selective school places go to more affluent families. Helping struggling, working families, missed by other poverty measures, has become the focus of Ms Greening's education reforms. Recent figures showed that most child poverty is now in working families. These \"ordinary working families\" are defined as not the poorest, but living on \"modest incomes\", and likely to live in suburbs and coastal towns away from London. Ms Greening is to give a speech at St Mary's University in London on Thursday saying the school system needs to find ways to support these families, along with the help already targeted at the most extremely disadvantaged. The university published research recently showing that counting pupils eligible for free school meals had become an unreliable measure of poverty. The researchers said that focusing on these pupils missed families who might be working multiple jobs and living in precarious financial circumstances, but above the threshold for free meals. The Department for Education has published a consultation on Wednesday on how schools should serve these \"ordinary working families\", described by Prime Minister Theresa May as \"just managing\". The consultation says that while there has been much attention and support for the very poorest families, there is \"very limited understanding\" of the experiences of children in families of \"modest incomes\". The education secretary is committed to increase selection and to create new grammar schools. And Ms Greening has rejected criticism that this will reinforce social divides. But the government's analysis in the consultation shows that more affluent children are currently much more likely to take places in grammar schools. In grammar schools, the consultation shows that 36% of places are taken by children from families with below-average incomes but not receiving free meals, compared with 53% of places taken by families with above-average incomes. In non-selective secondary schools, there are 35% of pupils from these \"ordinary\" families, and 32% from more affluent families, a much lower proportion than in grammars.", "question": "Education Secretary Justine Greening wants England 's schools , including a new @placeholder of grammars , to do more for \" ordinary working families \" .", "option_0": "generation", "option_1": "value", "option_2": "version", "option_3": "loss", "option_4": "capable", "label": 0}

His left-wing coalition is the first to take power in a eurozone country since Syriza won elections in Greece in January. One of his coalition partners, Left Bloc, has close ties with Syriza. Portugal finally left its three-year EU-IMF â‚¬78bn ($83bn; Â£55bn) bailout last year. But while unemployment has fallen to 12%, there are still high rates of poverty and government debt is at 130% of GDP. Although Mr Costa's coalition was the only viable option for Portugal, President Cavaco Silva insisted he agree to six key conditions (in Portuguese) before appointing him as prime minister. Among the most significant are compliance with eurozone budget rules and guarantees on the 2016 budget as well as respect for Portugal's commitments as part of its membership of Nato.

Woodward, meanwhile, has club commitments in London rather than north-west England. United are maintaining their long-established position of refusing to publicly discuss Van Gaal's future. Media playback is not supported on this device The Red Devils have won just two of their past 10 Premier League matches and are five points behind fourth-placed Tottenham. Van Gaal and his players were booed during and after Saturday's home game, in which they had just one shot on target. Appointed as successor to David Moyes in 2014, Van Gaal is just over halfway through a three-year contract. He took the team back into the Champions League in his first campaign but has been heavily criticised this season for both United's style of play and results. Van Gaal's side were eliminated in the group stage of the Champions League and have failed to score a first-half goal in their past 11 home games. Former chief executive David Gill, who is still a director of the club, said on Sunday the team have \"underachieved\". Should Woodward and the club's owners, the Glazer family, decide a change is required, the three favourites to replace Van Gaal are Pep Guardiola, Jose Mourinho and Ryan Giggs. United are reluctant to get into a public battle for Guardiola, given the widely held view the 45-year-old has already decided to join Manchester City when his Bayern Munich contract expires in the summer. Mourinho, 53, is available after his dismissal by Chelsea in December and is understood to be interested in the job should it become available. Giggs, 42, took charge for four matches following Moyes' sacking in April 2014, before accepting the role of Van Gaal's assistant.

{"article": "A survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors found price growth across the UK fell from 7% to 1%. It said Scotland's Land and Building Transaction Tax bands created a \"bottleneck\", discouraging some sales. The Scottish government insists LBTT is \"more progressive\" than stamp duty and \"benefits the vast majority\" of buyers. The transaction tax was introduced in April 2015 as a replacement for stamp duty north of the border. Holyrood's finance committee declared the introduction \"operationally successful\", but concerns have been aired about the top end of the market. The latest residential survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) found the lowest levels of price growth around the UK since 2013. Estate agents said may people considering moves in Scotland were instead making improvements in their existing homes, due to a limited choice of properties for sale. Rics believes LBTT bands are part of the problem, with policy manager Hew Edgar saying: \"This latest survey merely reinforces what we have been saying for some time - that the current LBTT bandings are creating a bottleneck in certain areas of the market, and encouraging property powers to eschew moving in favour of improving their current properties. \"The Scottish government must address this problem by reviewing the LBTT framework and putting in place a structure that would inject some much-needed fluidity into the market.\" The group's chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said sales activity across the UK had been slipping in recent months, and said the latest surveys suggested \"this could continue for some time to come\". A Scottish government spokesman said the Rics survey was \"not backed up by the latest property data\", arguing that the Scottish housing market had outperformed other parts of the UK in the first half of 2017.

Police said he was refused bail and would appear at Wyong Local Court on Monday. A forensic examination will be carried out on the firearm to determine whether can be linked to any shooting incidents. The gun was missing its barrel but police said initial examinations suggested it was in working order. Australia has very strict gun control laws. All firearms must be registered, and to use one a person must hold a licence. But it is estimated that there are as many as 260,000 illicit guns in circulation. Last week, Australia brought in a national gun amnesty because of the growing terrorism threat and an influx of illegal arms in the country. Those caught with prohibited weapons during that period face fines of up to A$280,000 ($212,730; Â£166,480) or up to 14 years in prison.

{"article": "The Commission said Poland would be stripped of its EU voting rights if it went ahead with proposals to force all Supreme Court judges into retirement. Warsaw hit out at EU \"blackmail\". Poland's president has vetoed two of the most controversial bills, but the government wants to press on with them, despite mass street protests. The European Commission's Vice-President, Frans Timmermans, said the reforms would have a \"very significant negative impact on the independence of the Polish judiciary\". He welcomed a decision by Polish President Andrzej Duda on Monday to veto some of the laws, including the one that would have overhauled the Supreme Court. But he said the Commission would launch immediate action to strip Poland of its voting rights if Warsaw went ahead with it anyway. Such a penalty, known as Article 7, requires the agreement of all EU member states, and Hungary says it will back Poland. A more realistic sanction at this stage is the threat of hefty fines imposed by the European Court of Justice, says the BBC's Adam Easton in Warsaw. Mr Timmermans said the Commission would sue Poland for breaking EU rules on judicial independence and on gender discrimination - because the legislation sets different retirement ages for male and female judges. But a government spokesman said he did not have enough knowledge of the draft bills to criticise them. \"We will not tolerate any blackmail from EU officials, especially blackmails that are not based on facts.\" Earlier this week Poland's Prime Minister Beata Szydlo vowed to press on with the reforms, saying the government would not \"yield to pressure from the street and from abroad\". It came after President Duda vetoed two laws and called for them to be amended, but approved a third. \"I'm absolutely a supporter of this reform, but a wise reform,\" said President Duda, an ally of the ruling Law and Justice party. In theory, the Polish parliament could now challenge the president's veto if the Law and Justice party can get enough support for the legislation in parliament. A more likely step would be to spend the next weeks redrafting the two bills that the president has turned down and seek his approval.

The forum - at a Westfields Marriott hotel in Chantilly - is also being attended by Trump critic Eric Schmidt, head of Google's parent company. Mr Schmidt has previously said the Trump administration will do \"evil things\". Other Bilderberg topics this year include, \"The war on information\", \"Why is populism growing?\", and \"Can globalisation be slowed down?\" \"There is no desired outcome, no minutes are taken and no report is written,\" the group's rules state. \"Furthermore, no resolutions are proposed, no votes are taken, and no policy statements are issued.\" Other guests include Dutch King Willem-Alexander; David Rubenstein, head of private equity juggernaut the Carlyle Group; and former CIA director John Brennan.

{"article": "The Theatre and the Hope were the first and last playhouses built in Elizabethan London. They join the Rose and the Globe as protected monuments to 16th and 17th Century theatre. The sites of three bear-baiting pits in the Bankside area have been listed. For more stories on archaeology follow our Pinterest board The Theatre was built in 1576-77 by James Burbage on the junction of Curtain Road and New Inn Yard in Hackney and a number of companies, including the Lord Chamberlain's Company which included William Shakespeare, were associated with it. It is believed to have been the first playhouse in which Hamlet was performed, in 1596 with Richard Burbage as the lead. Christopher Marlow's Faustus is thought to have first been put on at the theatre in 1592. After a financial dispute, Burbage's sons dismantled the theatre in late December 1598 and moved reusable parts south of the Thames to Bankside for use in construction of their new venture, the Globe. The remains of the Theatre now lie beneath a modern mixed-use building in Hackney. The Hope was the last of the playhouses of the era, opening in approximately 1614 after Philip Henslowe and two partners entered a contract to replace \"the Bear Gardens\" with a new building that would be a joint theatre and bear-baiting arena. The first play performed there was Ben Jonson's Bartholomew Fair but animal baiting and other entertainment gradually eclipsed the plays and the acting company left the Hope in 1617. It was ordered to close down by Parliament in 1643 but continued to operate until it was dismantled in 1656. The remains of the Hope are located beneath a car park on the southern side of Riverside House on Southwark Bridge Road. Duncan Wilson, chief executive of government heritage agency Historic England, said: \"The archaeological remains of the first and last Elizabethan playhouses to be built in London give us fleeting glimpses of a fascinating period in the history of theatre. \"They are where some of the world's greatest stories were first told and it is wonderful that they remain today, bearing witness to our fascinating past. \"Their cultural importance, particularly their connections with Shakespeare and Marlowe, means they deserve protection as part of England's precious historic fabric.\"", "question": "The archaeological remains of two Elizabethan playhouses , one of which saw the first performance of Shakespeare 's Hamlet , have been given listed @placeholder .", "option_0": "consent", "option_1": "sentiment", "option_2": "status", "option_3": "permission", "option_4": "unrest", "label": 2}

Chris initially thought he may have had an ulcer and was not concerned. \"My health was fine, I was a 40-something rugby player. I worked shifts and thought any tiredness was down to an unusual sleep pattern.\" But after receiving a pinprick test at his local blood clinic in Ballymoney, nurses told Chris that he could not donate blood because his iron levels were unusually low and advised him to visit his local GP who then referred him for a colonoscopy. Chris was then diagnosed with GIST, a rare cancer that occurs in the wall of the stomach and small intestine. Doctors discovered the 9cm (3.5in) tumour in March 2013 and carried out a successful operation at the Royal Victoria Hospital in May. \"I tried to keep things as normal as I could at home, I have two young girls.

The orchestra said it is negotiating with musicians to get rid of what it calls \"restrictive practices\". The orchestra assured MLAs it is trying to become less Belfast-centred. Sir George Bain, the executive chairman, told the committee it could send smaller groups of musicians out to towns that could not accommodate the full orchestra. He also added that musicians were paid full salaries even when not giving performances, but their contracts mean they could not be used for other projects, without extra payment. Earlier this month, Sir George revealed the orchestra would be forced to close by the end of the year unless it received £500,000 in emergency funding. Sir George Bain's warning came as he revealed the details behind a rescue plea to Belfast City Council that could mean a name change for the orchestra. It costs about £4.5m a year to run the Ulster Orchestra. It said it had lost 28% of funding from public sources - the equivalent of £1m - in the past four years. In a bid to survive, it has asked Belfast City Council to back a rescue plan that includes a £500,000 funding guarantee to keep it solvent until March next year when it would be restructured. It is also asking for the free use for the next five years of the Ulster Hall, which costs about £160,000 a year. According to Sir George, the orchestra could end up changing its name to something like the Belfast Symphony if the rescue plan was accepted. If the money is not forthcoming, the orchestra is warning it could go into administration before Christmas and close not long afterwards. It is the only full-time professional orchestra in Northern Ireland, and plays the majority of its concerts in Belfast's Ulster Hall and the Waterfront Hall.

Reality Check verdict: Free movement does make it harder to control immigration. But leaving the EU would not necessarily mean abandoning free movement, and the government has not managed to meet its immigration ambitions even for non-EU migrants, over whom it has greater control. This compares with migrants from outside the EU, for whom the UK currently has a points-based system that allows in people with skills needed in the economy as well as students and some temporary migrants. The UK is not signed up to the Schengen agreement, so passports are still checked at the borders. EU passport-holders are not automatically allowed in, but the bar is set quite high if EU citizens are to be rejected - just having a criminal record is not enough, they must pose a current threat. Last year, 2,165 EU passengers were turned away. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest the UK's annual net migration - the number who have come minus the number who have left - from the EU stands at 172,000. From outside the EU, it is 191,000. The Conservative manifesto in 2015 said the party would \"keep our ambition of delivering annual net migration in the tens of thousands, not the hundreds of thousands\". Clearly, even for just the non-EU migrants, over whom the government has greater control, the country is still well over that limit. It should be said Norway and Switzerland also currently accept free movement, despite not being part of the EU, in order to gain access to the single market.

An inquiry found the skipper negligent, with the vessel undermanned and carrying too many people. On Friday, a plaque was unveiled at Penmaenpool in memory of the victims, including four children. There were 42 people on board the ferry for the eight mile (13km) trip from Barmouth to the George III hotel when the disaster happened. An official inquiry found the boat was carrying six more passengers than the maximum 36 permitted under its certification. Furthermore, there should have been two crew members - one on the engine and one on the rudder. But there was only skipper Edward Llewelyn, 73 at the time, who was found to have acted negligently by a Board of Trade inquiry. The boat was also short of lifebelts and buoyancy apparatus was stowed away. While it was cruising in at slow speed towards the jetty, the force of the tide sent it crashing into the toll bridge, throwing all passengers into the water. \"I saw the boat coming up the river and the tide was very strong that day,\" said Ron Davies, now 82, who helped with the rescue. \"The boat didn't turn around and the tide washed the boat sideways against the bridge and wrecked it with people in the water straight away.\" Mr Davies, who rescued two boys, added: \"I wish I could have done more… but there we are… there's only so much I could do.\" Local people including the George III hotel owner and its staff and toll bridge keeper Idris Roberts went to the aid of passengers.

One of the tools contained in the Shadow Brokers leak, codenamed EternalBlue, proved to be \"the most significant factor\" in the spread of Friday's global attack, according to cyber-security firm Kaspersky Lab. The tool was said to have been created by the NSA - though, as is typical, the agency has neither confirmed nor denied this. EternalBlue was made public on 14 April, and while Microsoft had fixed the problem a month prior to its leak, it appeared many high-profile targets had not updated their systems to stay secure. Friday's attack has reignited the debate over whether or not governments should disclose vulnerabilities they have discovered or bought on the black market. \"It would be deeply troubling if the NSA knew about this vulnerability but failed to disclose it to Microsoft until after it was stolen,\" said Patrick Toomey, a lawyer working for the American Civil Liberties Union. \"These attacks underscore the fact that vulnerabilities will be exploited not just by our security agencies, but by hackers and criminals around the world. \"Patching security holes immediately, not stockpiling them, is the best way to make everyone's digital life safer.\" Edward Snowden, who famously leaked many internal NSA files in June 2013, criticised the NSA on Friday in a series of tweets. \"In light of today's attack, Congress needs to be asking [the NSA] if it knows of any other vulnerabilities in software used in our hospitals,\" he wrote. \"If [the NSA] had privately disclosed the flaw used to attack hospitals when they found it, not when they lost it, this may not have happened.\" However, others focused the blame at institutions for being too slow in updating their systems, given that this attack happened almost two months after a (free) fix was made available by Microsoft. \"Say what you want to say about the NSA or disclosure process,\" said Zeynep Tufeki, a professor at the University of North Carolina. \"But this is one in which what's broken is the system by which we fix.\" For the UK's National Health Service, the problem is perhaps more acute.

People start partying at least two weeks before the festival, which is being celebrated on 30 October in the north of India this year.  And in Delhi, families often try to outdo each other to throw \"the best party in the neighbourhood\". This usually translates to the latest Bollywood hit songs being played at deafening levels, some jaw popping - and bone dislocating - dance moves, and fabulous food. Another very Diwali tradition is gambling - a lot of people believe that winning money before the festival brings good luck. Teen Patti (Three Cards), a local variation of poker, is a favourite Diwali game, and the stakes vary from match sticks to some serious big bucks. People throwing their car keys and sometimes even their house keys on to the gambling table is not unheard of. The cartoon above depicts a man all ready to play some \"patti\" accompanied by his wife (patni in Hindi). Some nationalist groups have been running a serious social media campaign exhorting \"patriotic Indians\" to boycott Chinese products this festive season to boost domestic manufacturing, but it seems their appeal hasn't worked. Chinese products, like decorative lights, are relatively cheaper than their Indian counterparts - and everyone knows most Indians can't resist a good bargain! Let's be honest. Sweets (or meetha in Hindi) are what Diwali is really all about.  It's traditional to gift boxes of sweets to friends and family. And when offices, clients, acquaintances and the entire neighbourhood gets into the act, you're left with what can only be described as a tower of sweets.

It wants actors to get stunt pay for vocally stressful recording sessions and for such sessions to be restricted to two hours. It is also calling for performance bonuses each time a game sells two million copies. The strike has been supported by some prominent actors who have united on Twitter via the hashtag #PerformanceMatters. In a blogpost, Wil Wheaton, who provided voice-overs for Grand Theft Auto, explained why he is supporting the strike. \"I fully realise that for anyone who doesn't work as a voice actor it sounds insane to care about vocally stressful sessions,\" he said.

So-called \"tied pubs\" are required to buy supplies - often at high prices - from the companies that own the pubs. Campaigners said the \"historic\" vote would help \"secure the future of the Great British pub\". The amendment to the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill was put forward by Lib Dem Greg Mulholland. Mr Mulholland, the chairman of the all-party Parliamentary Save the Pub group, described the \"tie\" arrangement made between a pub and its owner as an \"archaic\" and \"extraordinary\" system. It is thought to be the government's first defeat on one of its own bills since the 2010 election. Ministers want to create a pubs code, aimed at helping pub landlords struggling to pay rent or beer costs. It includes the right to request a rent review after five years. But campaigners wanted the automatic right for pub landlords to exchange their tenancy for an independently-assessed market rent without any \"tie\". In an attempt to head off a defeat on the amendment, which was signed by MPs of all parties, Business Minister Jo Swinson said the government would introduce new measures to allow pub landlords to apply for \"market rent\" rates from after two years, if a review found other measures in the bill had not helped them sufficiently. But Mr Mulholland said this would be \"business as usual\". He told MPs the new clause, which was backed by Labour, had been drafted by lawyers and publicans and would come in gradually, reducing the impact on the industry.

{"article": "Most decided to hold their fire when confronted by a home secretary armed with a weighty and complex set of powers. But there are likely to be further skirmishes as parliament considers the details of her proposals. Theresa May's central argument is that the powers of the police and intelligence agencies need to be updated for the digital age, when criminals and terrorists are finding new means of communication. The most contentious issue is who should authorise the interception of communications. Her plan for the home secretary to approve warrants but then to require the approval of a judge seems to have appeased many of her critics. But there are still big concerns over the demand for internet companies to keep a record of which websites we use, even though they won't retain more details of our internet use. The shadow home secretary Andy Burnham set the tone of the debate when he urged MPs to send a unified message that the proposals were \"neither a snoopers' charter nor a plan for mass surveillance\". He said Theresa May had broadly got the balance right but there would be fears in Muslim communities that the powers could be used disproportionately. Some of the home secretary's most dangerous critics are on her own side. David Davis, a former shadow home secretary, said the bill was a step in the right direction. But he questioned who would appoint the judges who would sign the intercept warrants and raised concerns about the bulk retention of data. One of Mrs May's former colleagues, the ex-Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson, had very different concerns. Mr Paterson, who signed warrants when he was in office, said he believed such decisions should be taken by elected politicians and feared involving a judge would mean delays and complications on urgent cases. The former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg helped to kill off a previous bill which he called the \"snoopers' charter\" when he was in coalition with the Tories. He said today's proposals were \"much improved\", but warned: \"I have a feeling under the bonnet it still retains some of the flaws of its predecessor.\" This is a draft bill and now faces detailed consideration in the Lords as well as the Commons.

The Tories aim to replace it with a scheme called Journeys to Work, open to all ages, with jobs lasting for a year. Deputy Skills Minister Julie James claimed it was a \"ringing endorsement\" of Jobs Growth Wales, saying a new scheme was planned for all adults. Labour has hailed Jobs Growth Wales - which is part funded with EU money - a big success that has exceeded its targets on the number of jobs created. However, a review in 2014 found nearly three-quarters of participants would have found work anyway. In July, a committee of assembly members urged ministers to consider designing a similar scheme for the over-50s. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: \"Labour's age cap on job creation offers nothing to the many thousands of over-25s that want to get on and build a career for themselves. \"Not only does this sell hardworking people short, it's contributing to the acute skills shortage which is holding the Welsh economy back.\" The party said it would work with employers to make sure the jobs created lasted longer. But with no extra funding, the money spent on each job would be cut from the current average of Â£4,211 to Â£3,000. The announcement is part of a set of policies the Tories call Stronger Futures Cymru. They say they would work with businesses, schools and colleges to promote apprenticeships to students, and encourage schools to forge closer links with businesses in their communities. Responding for the Welsh government, Ms James said: \"They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and I welcome this ringing endorsement of our flagship skills policies. \"It is particularly pleasing that they are so popular that the opposition seek not only to continue them, but to extend them too.\" Ms James also confirmed plans to introduce a new scheme - Skills for Employment Wales - in April 2016 which would be open to all adults looking for work.

{"article": "Captain Ammar Jemal scored the winner for the Tunisians to add to his late equaliser in the first leg, which had finished 1-1. Sunday's game was played amid tight security, following Tuesday's bomb attack in Tunis, with a reduced crowd and an earlier kick-off time. Jemal - the 28-year-old centre back, who previously played in the German Bundesliga with FC Cologne and Ajaccio in the French Ligue 1 - emerged as his team's star, as Etoile won Africa's second-biggest club competition. His bundled finish in the 24th minute of Sunday's decider at the Olympic Stadium in Sousse added to his vital equaliser in the final minutes of last Saturday's first leg in Soweto, which cancelled out Thamsanqa Gabuza's strike. Jemal's second goal of the tie came after Pirates defender Happy Jele miscued a cross and the ball spun viciously back towards goal, with the centre-half managing to bundle the ball over the line. Originally scheduled for an 1830 GMT kick-off, the last major match of the African continental club season was brought forward by four-and-a-half hours. And the initial crowd limit of 20,000 in the 25,000-seat stadium was halved to 10,000 on the orders of Tunisian authorities. Pirates were already familiar with Tunisian teams, beating CS Sfaxien 1-0 in a Confederation Cup group game in Sfax four months ago. But that did not help in the two-legged final, as Jemal - deputising as captain for injured goalkeeper Aymen Mathlouthi - inspired Etoile to claim a ninth African title. It is also the fifth Tunisian success in 12 finals of the African equivalent of the Europa League, with Sfaxien having triumphed a record three times. In addition, it marks Etoile's first continental title since the 2008 Super Cup as well as coach Faouzi Benzarti's third African club title. Pirates were hoping to end a 14-year African trophy drought by South African clubs, but that wait goes on, with the 1995 African Cup of Champions Clubs (now African Champions League) and the 1996 Super Cup marking their last continental triumphs.

{"article": "The rocket and capsule system launched normally from its Van Horn, Texas, desert pad on Wednesday but then made an early separation during the ascent. A motor in the capsule pushed it clear to parachute back to the ground. The “abort” simulated what would happen if the booster were ever to develop a problem as it climbed into the sky. Before Mr Bezos’ Blue Origin company starts putting people on the New Shepard system, there has to be confidence that lives can be saved in the event of an emergency. New Shepard is a sub-orbital vehicle - that is, it delivers sufficient thrust to put its capsule only briefly into space. What is remarkable about New Shepard is that it is totally re-usable - both the booster and the capsule. Ordinarily, boosters are expendable. It is only recently that rocket vehicles have started to fly  themselves back to Earth after a flight for a new mission. The booster used in Wednesday’s outing was making its fifth flight. Before the test, Blue Origin said it was unlikely to survive the demonstration due to the instability that is introduced by a mid-flight escape of the capsule. But the booster had no difficulty handling the disruption of the abort manoeuvre and brought itself down under control. It will now be put on show in a museum. Mr Bezos plans to take fare-paying passengers who want to ride New Shepard on short hops above the atmosphere. Scientists will also be given the opportunity to fly experiments in the capsule. These are studies that need to be run in a weightless environment, which the capsule will experience at the top of its arc. The online retail entrepreneur also plans to build a much bigger rocket system that he will launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida.

In later life, Stanley won new fans when his work featured in the Coen brothers' O Brother, Where Art Thou?. The soundtrack to the 2000 film - which included Stanley's track O Death - sold millions and won the Grammy award for album of the year in 2002. Stanley won a Grammy himself that year for best male country vocal performance, beating the likes of Tim McGraw, Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash. Born and raised in Big Spraddle, Virginia, the Stanley siblings were taught to sing bluegrass and play the banjo by their parents Lee and Lucy. The brothers would later tour the US playing folk and bluegrass festivals, including the Newport Folk Festival in 1959 and 1964. When Carter died of liver disease in 1966, Ralph considered quitting but was persuaded to continue by messages from fans. He went on to perform at the inaugurations of Presidents Carter and Clinton, and received the National Medal of Arts from President George W Bush. Despite health problems, Stanley continued to record and tour into his 80s, often performing with his son Ralph Stanley II on guitar and Nathan on mandolin.

The camp was set up in November 2015, leading to a six-month court fight as the parliament sought eviction. The judge said he wanted to \"marshal his thoughts\" after the latest hearing. In court, parliament's lawyer Gerry Moynihan QC has argued that the group have every right to protest, but not to occupy land belonging to a third party permanently or for an indeterminate period. In the latest proceedings, lawyer Jamie Gardiner, acting for three of the campers, argued that they could only carry out this particular protest by being outside the parliament round the clock; this was the \"essence\" of the protest. He also suggested the camp had not caused much damage, although Lord Turnbull was critical of photographs which showed cars parked on the grass next to the camp despite a paid car park being visible across the road. The judge said this was \"arrogant, indifferent\" and \"blatantly self-interested\" conduct. Meanwhile, another camp respondent, Richard McFarlane, put forward an affidavit signed \"Christ, King of Scotland\" which denounced the court as illegitimate and called for the judges and the Queen to be executed. And another camper, Garry Mitchell, argued that evicting the IndyCamp would be \"an affront to democracy, to the rule of law and to this court\".

He went on to install his first portable defibrillator in an ambulance. Speaking about his invention to BBC Radio Ulster in 1988, Prof Pantridge said he did not create the device for personal gain or prestige but simply to save lives. \"People were getting cardiac arrests in a situation where the heart stops.

However, it reported a better-than-expected profit of $398m for the three months ending in December. This was partly due to a 27% increase in digital revenues from titles such as Madden NFL Ultimate Team and The Simpsons Tapped Out. The California-based company has been focused on increasing sales of its digital games, which earn higher margins compared to traditional packaged console games. EA chief executive Andrew Wilson said the company was having to cater to \"a new generation of games\". \"In addition to consoles, our mobile games, digital downloads and live services are growing year-over-year,\" he said in a statement.

In recent years, sales of older, traditional machine consoles such as the Microsoft Xbox 360 and Sony PlayStation 3 have dropped as users switch to playing games on their smartphones and tablets. As a result, the gaming industry has been shifting more of their resources to web software as less shoppers buy console hardware. Analysts say another strategy includes releasing fewer but bigger next-generation game titles. EA for example, plans to release science-fiction shooter game Titanfall as an exclusive title for Microsoft's Xbox consoles and personal computers in March. Over the next two years, it is also expected to release games licensed from Walt Disney's Star Wars franchise.

The reason the national rainfall picture is so skewed towards around about average is that the rainfall that has occurred so far this June has been very localised, in the form of heavy, thundery (and what meteorologists refer to as) convective activity. The month actually started on a fairly dry note. Western Scotland, Northern Ireland and west Wales saw temperatures climb well into the mid to high 20s, and those warm conditions were mimicked across the south of the UK at other times in the early part of the month. From around the second week of June onwards, the weather turned far more unsettled. For the past couple of weeks, low pressure systems have often lingered over parts of the UK. These slow moving low pressure systems and troughs tend to distribute any rainfall in a haphazard fashion across the land, in contrast to the organised bands of rain that tend to sweep in from the Atlantic and deposit rain more evenly. The random distribution of showers is best reflected in the way that some parts of the Midlands and south-east England have seen around twice as much as the June average rainfall already, with western Scotland and the northern Isles having a meagre 20 to 30% of their June average rainfall so far this month. When we average these regional fluctuations out, we arrive at the conclusion that, so far this month, rainfall has been just that - pretty average.", "question": "Heavy rainfall affected many parts of south - east England overnight into Thursday morning , causing localised flooding and travel @placeholder across areas including central London .", "option_0": "remaining", "option_1": "dominates", "option_2": "special", "option_3": "disruption", "option_4": "major", "label": 3}

He went on the run after the killing, but was captured in Spain in 1998. He was jailed in 2000 with a minimum term set at 16 years in 2002 by the then Home Secretary David Blunkett. The parole board considered a request from Noye to be released from Wayland Prison in Norfolk. Being moved to an open prison is the first stage of the process that usually leads to release. Such an intervention by the Secretary of State is rare, with fewer than 1% of Parole Board recommendations being turned down over the last five years. About 40 recommendations out of up to 6,000 from 2010 to this year have been rejected by the Justice Secretary. Noye is entitled to another parole hearing within two years.

Ministers gave Â£60,000 to the Safeguarding Communities, Reducing Offending (Sacro) scheme last year. It was created in an effort to keep people aged 12 to 24 charged with sectarian offences out of court. More than 1,000 charges have been brought under the Scottish government's Offensive Behaviour at Football Act since its launch, leading to more than 200 criminal prosecutions, official figures up to 2015-16 show. However, prosecutors have sent just 34 people to Sacro's anti-sectarian services programme, with only 22 people completing it. All four of Holyrood's opposition parties have pledged to repeal the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act. Liberal Democrat justice spokesman Liam McArthur, who uncovered the Sacro data, said the low uptake to the programme of those charged under the act was a cause for concern. He said ministers needed to work with the Crown Office to make sure the most was made of the resource. \"Sacro's diversion-from-prosecution scheme is something that has the potential to make a big difference,\" he said. \"The fact that uptake is so low is therefore a concern. \"The Scottish government has provided funding, but more needs to be done to ensure that the Crown Office are making use of the programme when this is the best option. \"Unless action is taken, SNP ministers leave themselves open to the charge of having no interest in genuinely addressing the huge flaws in the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act (OBFA) or supporting schemes that help keep people out of court.\" In response to the figures, Ms Ewing said she would meet with the Lord Advocate to discuss the issue.

A lawyer for the congressman, a former FBI agent and marine, has said the case against Mr Grimm was \"politically driven\". \"Congressman Grimm asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing,\" William McGinley said. The New York congressman, who was elected in 2010, was caught on camera in January threatening to throw a reporter who questioned him about an investigation into his campaign funding off a balcony in the US capitol building. He later apologised. According to an indictment released on Monday, in 2007-10 Mr Grimm was running the day-to-day operations of Healthalicious, a restaurant in New York city's Manhattan borough, when he under-reported more than $1m in sales, reducing his tax costs. He paid workers in untracked cash and hired workers who were in the US illegally, further reducing the business' tax burden, the indictment alleges. Prosecutors said Mr Grimm lied about these practices under oath during a deposition for a lawsuit filed by workers at the restaurant. \"In 2007, Michael Grimm, former Marine, former FBI agent, accountant and attorney, was poised for success as a small business owner,\" US Attorney Loretta Lynch said on Monday. \"Instead, as alleged, Grimm made the choice to go from upholding the law to breaking it.

In only a week the fans have made the impossible possible,\" Finbarr O'Connell said. Caterham sat out the last two grands prix in the United States and Brazil. Although the team is currently just under £500,000 short of its target, sponsors have come on board to make up the shortfall. The crowd-funding initiative offered rewards to investors ranging from Caterham-branded earplugs and caps through to used race suits and carbon engine covers. O'Connell, representing administrator Smith & Williamson, added: \"We knew that the best way to keep this team alive and attract possible buyers was to show that it's still a racing team and be in Abu Dhabi for the finale. \"There aren't enough words to say how grateful we are to all the fans who have made this possible. \"We now head to Abu Dhabi ready to show what a hard-working and positive group of people this is and to hopefully secure a future for the team.\" O'Connell earlier told BBC Sport the team was close to signing a contract that would \"press the green button\" on its return. He revealed the contract awaiting completion related to a driver, with at least one vacancy at the team following Marcus Ericsson's decision to terminate his association with the team with immediate effect. \"There's a variety of contracts but this particular one is with one of the drivers we've been talking to,\" he said. O'Connell declined to reveal the names of any drivers under consideration by the Oxfordshire-based outfit, although British female driver Alice Powell had been hopeful of securing a drive in free practice. However, Powell tweeted on Friday it was \"very unlikely\" that would happen due to problems getting a super licence. O'Connell added that the income brought by the driver deal would \"go into the pool\" of money so far raised by Caterham's crowd-funding project, which is due to expire at midnight on Friday. As of 14:30 GMT on Friday the fund stood at just over £1.87m - 79% of the £2.35m target stated when the scheme was launched a week ago.

{"article": "Pope Tawadros II had been in one of the two churches targeted on Palm Sunday when 45 people were killed in attacks claimed by so-called Islamic State. Security has been tightened at churches across Egypt and Easter celebrations have been scaled back. Both suicide bombers were Egyptians, the government said. A three-month state of emergency was imposed following the bombings in Alexandria and the Nile Delta city of Tanta. The attacks on Christians, who make up about 10% of Egypt's population, raised security fears ahead of a visit to Cairo by Pope Francis, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, scheduled for 28 and 29 April. In a visit to Pope Tawadros, President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi vowed to hunt down those who had organised the bombings. Good Friday is the day Christians commemorate the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. \"With these incidents we are now living with Christ in his pain,\" Coptic Bishop Kirillos told AFP news agency. \"Given the current circumstances and our solidarity with the families of the dead, we are going to limit our celebrations to Easter Mass,\" the Church said in a statement. There would be no decorations in churches and rooms normally reserved for the reception of worshippers wishing to exchange season's greetings would remain closed, an official at the Coptic patriarchate told AFP. Another Coptic bishop, Macarius, told Reuters news agency earlier that the Church wanted greater guarantees of security. \"We can consider ourselves in a wave of persecution but the Church has gone through a lot in 20 centuries,\" he said. \"There are waves of persecution. It reaches to the highest point like a pyramid and then it goes down again. We are at a very high point.\" Victims of the attacks will be mourned at Masses on Saturday night. The bombers were both identified as coming from the southern province of Qena. One used to work for a petroleum company and was linked to a cell that carried out the attack on a Cairo church last December, in which 25 people were killed. He blew himself up after being stopped by police at the gates of St Mark's Cathedral in Alexandria, where Pope Tawadros was leading a Palm Sunday service. The other bomber was identified as a member of a \"terrorist\" cell. Meanwhile, in the province of Minya, Muslims fought with Christians who had tried praying in an abandoned home in a village on Thursday, AFP reports.

{"article": "Labour and Plaid Cymru both pledge to raise it from 10 to 30 hours a week. The Public Policy Institute for Wales (PPIW) said this would have no \"substantial impacts on net income, poverty or work behaviour\". Labour said it would help working parents, employers and the economy.  Plaid said children were its priority. The report said an extra 20 hours free childcare for three to four-year-olds would not have \"substantial impacts on net income, poverty or work behaviour for families with children\". It said this was because a \"relatively small proportion\" of families with children of this age use formal paid childcare and those that do \"tend to pay moderate amounts\". Any savings on childcare costs would be partly offset by reductions in other benefits, the report found. Lead author Dr Gillian Paull said: \"If the aim is to encourage women to return to work, or to help more disadvantaged families with the costs of childcare, our analysis suggests that extending free childcare for three to four-year-olds from ten hours to 30 hours will not achieve this to any significant degree.\" PPIW deputy director Dan Bristow said the findings raised \"serious questions\" about Welsh ministers' funding for additional free childcare. \"They show that it has no significant impact on the number of mothers entering paid employment and spending by the Welsh government simply displaces the UK government's spending on benefits,\" he said. But Labour's Communities and Tackling Poverty Minister Lesley Griffiths responded: \"We are very clear that people who are working hard to provide for their families deserve a helping hand. \"Wherever I go in Wales, hard-working parents of young children tell me childcare costs and availability are a major problem for them.\" Plaid Cymru AM Simon Thomas said:  \"The main aim of childcare is to provide additional support to children, not the economy. \"We know that there is already an attainment gap of up to nine months for children from deprived backgrounds compared to their better-off peers.

The UK would risk a higher proportion of its exports. \"Don't just look at it from a UK perspective,\" he said. \"The European Union has a massive surplus in goods with the UK. Who does it harm more if we end up in a new tariff environment?\" The EU does indeed have a trade surplus with the UK in goods, which means that EU countries sell more goods to the UK than they buy from us. The UK economy, which is dominated by the service sector, has a trading surplus in services with the EU, which is not big enough to cancel out the deficit in goods. But Dr Fox was talking about goods, not services. In 2015, the UK trade figures show the UK exported Â£134bn worth of goods to the EU and imported Â£223bn worth. The question Dr Fox asked was who it would harm more if there were tariffs introduced, which damaged that trade. In cash terms, clearly the EU has more to lose. But in percentage terms the picture is different. UK exports of goods to the EU in 2015 accounted for 47% of total goods exports. According to the NIESR, EU goods exports to the UK account for about 16% of its total exports of goods. So if you're looking at whether the UK or the EU would risk a greater proportion of their trade from tariffs, clearly the UK would lose more. There may be some impact on these figures from what's called the Rotterdam Effect, but it makes a relatively small difference, as we discussed in this Reality Check.

Despite his experience in the assembly, political opponents have tended to portray Mr Jones as sceptical on devolution - something his allies say is unfair.

In future he envisages banking will be made much simpler - with people able to conduct transactions on social media platforms such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. Accenture is currently working with a number of UK banks to allow customers to interact with their banks - get balance information and transfer money - via Amazon's smart home speaker Alexa. He also imagines how banks could use systems such as Alexa to transcribe conversations with customers to cut down on \"form-filling\". \"Rather than sit down and log on to a website, people want to interact naturally,\" said Mr McIntyre.

Observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States - a grouping of former Soviet republics - said the elections were open and transparent.

As some viewers shun expensive cable TV subscriptions in favour of streaming services, investors have worried about the prospects of a network that has traditionally been a cash-cow for the company. The stake in BAMTech, which was once part of Major League Baseball's media business, reflects Disney's attempt to reflect viewers' changing habits. It will develop a multi-sport subscription streaming service with BAMTech. However, Disney said that content from ESPN's cable networks would not be carried by the new streaming service. That reflects the company's attempt not to cannibalise cable subscribers - and the lucrative fees it earned from cable companies in return for carrying ESPN. Disney chief executive Bob Iger said the firm would work with BAMTech to \"explore new ways to deliver the unmatched content of the Walt Disney Company across a variety of platforms\". Disney will have the option to buy a majority stake in the future.

Her letter comes after Wikileaks published a transcript of IMF officials discussing bailout negotiations. One says a \"crisis\" could force a deal. Greece publicly demanded an explanation after the leak, suggesting the comments meant the IMF could be planning to deliberately prolong debt negotiations until the country was close to running out of money. Greek debt: What's the deal? Debt jargon explained Ms Lagarde said the \"incident\" had made her \"concerned as to whether we can indeed achieve progress\", but said she had decided to allow the IMF team to return to Athens to continue debt discussions. However, she also warned that the latest bailout deal was \"still a good distance away\". She said that the IMF could only support a deal that would enable \"robust growth\" for Greece, while also allowing it to tackle its debt repayments. Last year, Greece agreed a multi-billion dollar bailout with the EU and IMF that was needed for the country to avoid bankruptcy and stay in the eurozone. Talks between Greece, the EU and the IMF on a bailout review, assessing Greece's progress at implementing money-saving reforms and aimed at unlocking further loans, are due to resume this week. The review has been suspended twice since January due to disagreement among the lenders over the estimated size of Greece's fiscal gap by 2018, as well as different opinions on pension reforms and how bad loans are being managed. \"In the interest of the Greek people, we need to bring these negotiations to a speedy conclusion,\" wrote Ms Lagarde.", "question": "International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde has dismissed reports that the body is trying to push Greece towards default as \" simply @placeholder \" .", "option_0": "distasteful", "option_1": "madness", "option_2": "meaningless", "option_3": "fashioned", "option_4": "nonsense", "label": 4}

The job prospects for young Spaniards, Poles, Italians, were arguably a bigger determinant for UK immigration than anything the UK government could do about European immigration at least. For as long as we have freedom of movement, part of the deal of being in the EU, we can't put a limit on the numbers, nor the rest of the EU put a limit on the number of Brits who could move around the EU. It's also worth saying that immigration from the rest of the world, on its own, has also been well over the target of \"tens of thousands\" - and remember, that's the bit that is easier to control. You can see the numbers here, since the Tories came into government in 2010: Once we are out of the EU, controlling those numbers will in theory be easier. It will be the UK that decides how many people can come from around Europe, as they currently do with the rest of the world. But while Theresa May has staunchly recommitted to the target she, as home secretary, missed for six years in a row, ministers have been also busy reassuring businesses they will be able to get the people they need, whether builders, bankers, or fruit pickers. If the economy needs them, they will be allowed to come. That doesn't sound like a recipe for getting the numbers down to Theresa May's preferred level. And even though we are on our way out of the EU, there is still huge scepticism over whether the target is remotely achievable. So why keep it? Sometimes in politics it's useful to ponder what would happen if they did the opposite. Ditch the immigration target after the referendum when public concern about the levels was so obvious? Ditch it when the Tories want to pick up as many former UKIP voters as possible? Ditch it when Theresa May has spent years, with limited success, trying different ways of getting it down?

The report found financial pressures had meant the MoD only carried out essential maintenance on its estate since 2009 which had led to a \"steady decline\" in its overall condition. It said: \"There is a significant risk that the poor condition of the estate will affect the department's ability to provide the defence capability needed. \"The estate is an important element of defence capability, enabling the armed forces to train and undertake operations, and providing accommodation for personnel and their families. \"The department's inability to invest sufficient funds may jeopardise the delivery of new and existing capabilities.\" The National Audit Office found constraints on funding had led to decisions that were \"poor value for money in the longer term\". This included the decision to sell and lease back the majority of service family accommodation which was now limiting the MoD's ability to manage it cost effectively. The NAO also criticised a deal made with Capita in 2014 that saw it become the MoD's \"strategic business partner\" to help it achieve savings.

The statement highlighted fighting in the rebel-held region of Wadi Barada near Damascus. In recent weeks the rebels have accused the government and its allies of trying to recapture the area, which supplies water to the capital. The military has denied the allegations. On New Year's Eve, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to welcome the Russia-Turkey efforts to end the Syrian fighting and to organise peace talks. The new ceasefire deal applies across Syria but excludes the jihadists of so-called Islamic State (IS) and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (JFS), and the Kurdish YPG militia. On the one side, Syrian government forces, allied militias and the Russian military. On the other, the FSA plus several other groups.

It gives you a strong sense of period - some terrific short hemlines on the girls -  yet also well-drawn characters that evolve with the band,\" Letts continued. The Telegraph's Charles Spencer also awarded five stars at Thursday's opening, noting the show had \"the whole audience up on its feet and in state of blissful euphoria by the end\". He said director Edward Hall \"marvellously nails the humour and the pathos of the piece\" and praised Miriam Buether's set design featuring scores of speaker cabinets. \"It is an irresistibly enjoyable and touching night, and anyone who loves pop music at its greatest would be mad to miss it,\" Spencer concluded. \"The songs joyously reach out to the audience, even as they are shown to be rooted in a wider, difficult and daft world of class, family, professional struggle and private agony,\" said Nick Hasted in his four-star review for The Arts Desk. \"In The Kinks' 50th Anniversary year, their spirit could hardly be better revived.\" Also awarding four stars, the Evening Standard's Henry Hitchings praised the lead performances. \"John Dagleish is immense as [Ray] Davies, capturing his quirkiness and charisma.

The last batch will expire in June 2016 and there is no comparable replacement. Manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur says it has been priced out of the market. Alternatives are available but MSF says they are not as good. Fav-Afrique is the only anti-venom that has been proven safe and effective to treat envenoming from different types of snakes across Sub-Saharan Africa, it says. Sanofi said it will share the anti-venom recipe with others. The company stopped producing the serum last year and has since switched to making a rabies treatment instead. Sanofi is believed to be negotiating for another company to produce Fav-Afrique, but these talks are not expected to be finalised before late 2016. This means that a replacement product could not be expected to reach the market for another two years, says MSF. The absence of a broad, safe and effective anti-venom until then will translate into countless deaths, it says.

Ms Bradley has been weighing up whether to refer the deal to Ofcom after warning it could pose \"public interest considerations\" that warranted further investigation.

But in the letter, Mr Palker said the minister had not fully taken into account 21st Century Fox's decision to spin off News Corp in 2011. He also said her \"provisional view\" of the deal was based on a flawed report about media plurality, prepared by campaign group Avaaz and the Media Reform Coalition.

{"article": "The government was twice defeated in the House of Lords over a £30 a week cut to Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) for certain claimants. But it is set to go ahead after peers deferred to the elected Commons. Ministers claimed \"financial privilege\" to assert the Commons' right to have the final say on budgetary measures. Ministers argue the changes will encourage people to get into work, but this is strongly disputed by opponents. The cuts in weekly support from £103 to £73, contained in the Welfare Reform and Work Bill, will apply to new ESA claimants in the work-related activity group, bringing the rate into line with Jobseeker's Allowance. It will affect people who are deemed unable to work at the moment but capable of making some effort to find employment, including attending work-focused interviews and taking part in training. Ministers argue that too few people in the category are moving into work and that while the lower benefit rate would save £55m in the first year, £60m would be spent on supporting claimants to take steps towards finding work. Work and Pensions minister Lord Freud acknowledged peers were only withdrawing their opposition with \"great reluctance\" after the Commons asserted financial privilege - its right to overrule any Lords proposal that has cost implications. He insisted that the Lords had \"discharged their duty\" by scrutinising the bill to remove \"unintended consequences\" and sending back concerns for the Commons to reconsider. But Paralympic gold medallist Baroness Grey-Thompson said she was disappointed such a \"dreadful and punitive\" part of the bill - which has been opposed by more than 30 charities - was going ahead. \"It may be seen as a victory in terms of voting numbers in the Commons but we can't forget there are many disabled people who will lose out,\" the crossbench peer said. And Baroness Campbell of Surbiton, the co-chair of Parliament's All Party Disability Group, said she could not believe \"the niceties of parliamentary protocol\" had been allowed \"to trump the lives of disabled people\". The peer, who was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy when she was a baby and has become one of the UK's leading disability rights campaigners, said there was little evidence to back up the government's claims and \"environmental and attitudinal discrimination\" was the main obstacle holding disabled people back in the workplace.

{"article": "I am told that discussions were held with the head of the FCA in recent weeks where it was made clear that the chancellor would not be asking Mr Wheatley to stay on when his contract came up for renewal in March 2016. With that sword hanging over his head, Mr Wheatley decided that he would go early. The Treasury has always had a scratchy relationship with Mr Wheatley who famously said he would \"shoot first\" and ask questions later when he came across wrong doing in the financial services sector. The banking industry didn't much like such a gung-ho attitude and Mr Wheatley was often the subject of poisonous comments from senior banking executives. The FCA also blundered over leaked details of an inquiry into the savings industry. You can read about that shambles here. Mr Wheatley was very much his own man and he received widespread praise for his aggressive \"pro-consumer\" attitude - for example leading the charge against the payday loan industry. The problem seems to be, he wasn't Mr Osborne's man. So, the Treasury got rid of Mr Wheatley. And it is now becoming clear that the head of the FCA is not happy about that at all. Talking to those close to the now former head of the FCA, it seems he believes the Treasury was looking for a \"big signal\" that it was time for a different type of relationship with the City. Less banker bashing, more supportive of the changes that the City believes it has made on issues of conduct since the financial crisis. It seems Mr Wheatley did not fit the bill. I asked one person if Mr Wheatley \"felt sore\" about how he had been treated. \"Oh yes,\" came the reply. In the chancellor's Mansion House speech, George Osborne spoke of \"a new settlement\" with the financial services sector. Mr Wheatley believed he was talking a similar language, saying that the FCA's aggressive push on conduct issues (look at the large fines for foreign exchange manipulation) had successfully pushed the issue to the level of the board room. Where it should be, he believed. It seems Mr Wheatley agreed that the tone and the way of working should now be subtly changed - very much because of the success of the FCA in its more tub-thumping start-up phase (the regulator was formally launched in 2013).

Mencap says the total bill for back pay  - due by September, and in some cases dating back six years - could be £400m. The government says carers should be paid fairly. The national minimum wage for those aged 25 and over is £7.50 an hour, which will increase to £9 by 2020. While on night shifts, most employees providing care in people's own homes are allowed to sleep, providing they can be woken to deal with any incidents. According to minimum wage legislation, employers must take into account shifts where staff are allowed to sleep as long as they are \"at work and under certain work-related responsibilities\". Until recently, many overnight carers were paid a flat rate allowance for the 'sleep-in', with additional wages paid for work carried out. Smaller care charities were on the brink of disaster as a result of the changes, said Derek Lewis, Chairman of Mencap. The charity lost an appeal in April this year, against a ruling that it was wrong to have paid a support worker £29.05 for a nine-hour sleep-in shift. Mr Lewis said: \"The carer is only there 'just in case' to provide safety and reassurance and is rarely disturbed. \"There will be a major impact on the 5,500 people we support and some may even end up losing that support all together. \"For many smaller care providers across the country the financial impact will be devastating.\" Mencap employ around 5,500 carers on an overnight basis, and says it plans to appeal further next year. A government spokesperson said: \"We recognise the vital role social care providers play in supporting some of the most vulnerable people in our society and workers in that sector should be paid fairly for the important job they do. \"As the Prime Minister has said, the government is considering this issue extremely carefully and we will continue to work with the industry to ensure any action taken to protect workers is fair and proportionate.\" Unison, which represents a number of overnight carers, said: \"It's the government's failure to fund social care properly that risks devastating the care sector, not the workers asking for a legal wage . \"Charities and care companies have known for a long time they must pay sleep-in staff at least the minimum wage.

But Cambridgeshire Police said the force had been told the Haddenham gathering on 23 and 24 September was in aid of Help for Heroes. Mr Donaldson died in a car crash in Derbyshire in 1993, aged 36. Blood and Honour has been banned in a number of countries across Europe and in Russia. Matthew Collins, from the Hope not Hate campaign group, told the BBC the gathering was an annual Blood and Honour event following the death of Mr Donaldson and had moved around the UK because it had \"struggled to find venues that will host them\". He said there were a number of banning orders against the group in other countries due to imagery used at concerts and links to violent extremism. About three-quarters of those attending travelled from Europe to be at the event and this included people from countries that ban Blood and Honour. A witness to the event, who wished to remain anonymous, described seeing \"a lot of cars, a big bonfire and a lot of music\". \"The one that I heard was a song about white power and this kept going on and on.  It was very loud and distinctive.\" East Cambridgeshire District Council said a temporary event notice was filed online for a \"private party with music\". It said, like all applications, it was passed to the police to see if they had any objections and, as none were raised, the event went ahead. Help For Heroes said the event was not registered with the charity, adding it was \"strictly non-political\" and it did not accept donations from extremist groups. Mr Collins said it was \"disappointing\" the event had been allowed but he was \"aware of a number of occasions when the police appear to have been caught short about the activities of the extreme far right\".

According to allegations in a US Department of Justice statement, Viet Quoc Nguyen and Giang Hoang Vu hacked into eight separate email providers in the US between 2009 and 2012. The DoJ said they used this access to steal more than one billion email addresses in what it said was the \"largest\" data breach in US history. The DoJ also alleges that the pair used their access to the internal systems of the email providers to help them despatch junk messages to tens of millions of people. The trade earned them millions of dollars from spam and from websites that paid to have traffic directed to them via junk mail, said the DoJ. Some of the spam sent sought to make people pay for software they could get free elsewhere. Vu was extradited to the US from Holland in 2014 and has pleaded guilty to committing computer fraud. He is due to be sentenced next month. Nguyen remains a fugitive, said the DoJ. Also charged is Canadian David-Manuel Santos Da Silva who, the US alleges, helped Vu and Nguyen generate cash from their stolen email addresses and by laundering the money they made.

He fled to Thailand shortly afterwards with his wife. Mr Dong was released in February this year after spending 10 months in jail in China for taking part in an event to remember people killed following protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989. He arrived in Thailand with his wife and daughter in September. Both Chinese dissidents, who were due to be settled in a third country by the UN, were recently fined for breaking Thai immigration rules. Amnesty International said that while the two were in jail and waiting to be resettled abroad, their fines were paid by someone not known to either man. It appears they were then transferred to an immigration detention centre before being deported over the weekend. Amnesty believes the two men have been returned to China and are \"at risk of torture and other ill treatment\". Three other people are thought to have been deported with the two dissidents. There is speculation that one of them is Hong Kong-based publisher Gui Minhai, who has not been heard from since arriving last month in the Thai resort of Pattaya, where he owns a holiday home.

She left her grandmother's house in Coatbridge on 23 February 1957 to go to the shops but she never returned. Police divers are expected to begin searching the canal on Monday. A specialist search team began the first phase of the search of the canal earlier this week. The operation focused on a 170m (185 yards) stretch of canal at Carnbroe. Although it is 3.5m (11.5ft) deep, around 2m (6.5ft) of that is silt. The team were joined by leading experts including soil forensic expert Professor Lorna Dawson and forensic anthropologist Prof Sue Black. Geoforensics expert Prof Alastair Ruffell, as well as a national search advisor from the National Crime Agency and representatives of the Home Office's applied sciences and technology department have also worked on the operation. The search involved the use of ground penetrating radar, sonar scanning and magnetometry, which identifies magnetic anomalies within the water and silt layer of the canal. The force said the techniques resulted in the identification of \"five distinct areas of anomalies\". Divers from its marine unit will begin their investigation of those areas on Monday, when they will focus on identifying and removing any relevant items. Bus driver and convicted paedophile Alexander Gartshore, who died in 2006, is suspected of Moira Anderson's murder. When she left her grandmother's house during a heavy snowstorm, she boarded a Baxter's bus that was driven by Gartshore. Later that year, he was jailed for raping a 17-year-old babysitter. In 1999, convicted child abuser James Gallogley named his former friend Gartshore as Moira's murderer. Gartshore's own daughter Sandra Brown was convinced he was the killer and campaigned to have him charged. In 2014 prosecutors took the unusual step of announcing that Gartshore would have faced prosecution for the schoolgirl's murder if he were still alive.

I was struck by how business got on with it and I didn't feel we had the luxury of endless debates as we have seen in the political world,\" said Lord Hill. Both Lord Hill and Sir Paul still think the other was wrong but Brexit Secretary David Davis, who addressed the conference, appreciated the display of pragmatism. The conference could in part be seen as a lack of faith in government's ability to handle the complexity of the negotiations that lie ahead. Lord Hill said that his former colleagues in Whitehall would be approaching them with a theoretical approach rather than one informed by practical experience. The business lobby was largely in favour of Remain and super-wealthy hedge fund managers like Sir Paul are card carrying members of the global elite that Theresa May has been so scathing about.

Disarmament experts began their work inside Syria on Tuesday. But they will be hampered by ongoing fighting around the country - including clashes between anti-regime factions. At least 19 troops and pro-government militiamen have been killed since Monday in rebel attacks on Barzeh district, to the north of Damascus, reported the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. And in the town of Azaz on the border with Turkey, the UK-based activist group reported heavy clashes between al-Qaeda-linked fighters and Western-backed rebels on Wednesday. The clashes, between militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) and the Free Syrian Army (FSA), have erupted since ISIS forced FSA rivals out of Azaz last month. The discord - driven by claims over territory and resources as well as ideological differences - adds a new layer of complexity to the conflict which has killed over 100,000 people in two years. More than two million Syrians have fled the conflict in their country, and many more have been displaced internally. The statement agreed by the Security Council on Wednesday highlights those displaced and trapped by the \"unacceptable and escalating level of violence\" in Syria. The nearly six million of internally displaced, \"nearly half of whom are children, are in need of immediate humanitarian assistance\" without which \"their lives will be at risk\". It condemns \"widespread violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the Syrian authorities\", as well as \"any\" such violations by armed groups. And it deplores the heavy price paid by civilians caught in the conflict, saying Syrian authorities \"bear the primary responsibility to protect their populations\" - urging them to provide safe and unhindered access to populations in need of assistance. Aid agencies complain that the Syrian government has hindered access to visas and tried to limit the number of foreign groups operating in the country. Following the adoption of the statement, UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos said the Council's task was now \"to turn these strong words into meaningful action\". Syria's ambassador to the UN, Bashar Jaafari, said the Syrian government would study the council statement before responding. On Tuesday, the opposition Syrian National Coalition warned that thousands of families around Damascus, in an area under siege from pro-government forces, were at risk of starving to death.

Brazil's Foreign minister, Luiz Alberto Figueiredo, said he has told the Canadian ambassador in Brasilia, Jamal Khokhar, that he was \"indignant.\" \"The government expresses its repudiation of this serious and unacceptable violation of the national sovereignty and of people's and company's rights,\" the minister's statement read. On Sunday evening, a popular TV show, which had already broadcast spying allegations involving President Rousseff and the Brazilian oil company Petrobras, aired the the latest leaks revealed by the Rio de Janeiro-based American journalist Glenn Greenwald, a reporter for Britain's Guardian newspaper. Canadian officials told their US, British, New Zealand and Australian counterparts â€“ the group reportedly known as Five Eyes â€“ that they had successfully monitored a communications network of the mines and energy ministry, the report said. The network is said to be frequently used in exchanges between the ministry, energy and oil agencies and the state oil and energy companies. Writing on Twitter shortly after Sunday's report was aired, President Dilma Rousseff demanded a change by the US authorities and noted that she had already criticised the spying at the United Nations General Assembly, in September. She also instructed the ministry to step up the security measures surrounding its networks. On Monday, Ms Rousseff used the social media network to say that the activities were \"inadmissible among countries that aim to be partners.\" \"We repudiate the cyber warfare,\" she wrote. Speaking at the opening of the UN General Assembly, Ms Rousseff said Brazil would adopt legislation and technology to protect itself from illegal intercepts.

Australia's new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's designated nickname is indeed \"sugar bun\".

It is hard to find any politicians from China or overseas who attract such affectionate nicknames. This was probably just a fortuitous homonym. So while it doesn't necessarily denote anything more significant and is unlikely to be dripping with symbolism, could it be that they expect him to have a place in the national debate? Malcolm Turnbull's son Alex speaks Mandarin and is married to Wang Yiwen who, reports say, is the daughter of a Chinese academic.

It takes data from Google Trends about searches for Facebook, maps it against similar data for MySpace - and concludes that users will abandon today's leading social network just as they did with its forerunner. What that ignores is that social networking was in its infancy when MySpace peaked, with new users arriving on the scene and being able to choose which service to adopt - then switching as something else came along. Today, it's a far more mature market - existing users have made their choice and are going to take some convincing to go elsewhere, whereas new users are more likely to go to where their friends already hang out. And that very often means Facebook. But this latest story once again sparked headlines around the world, even if articles often made the point that the research was not peer-reviewed. What was different, however, was Facebook's reaction. Previously, its PR team has gone into overdrive behind the scenes to rubbish this kind of research but said nothing in public.

The Council of Mortgage Lenders said it had worked \"exceptionally well\", making mortgages more available when it started in October 2013. However Shelter has argued that the scheme helped to push up house prices. Under the programme, borrowers were able to get a mortgage with just a 5% deposit. If those borrowers were unable to make payments, the government promised to compensate the lender. But around 30 banks or building societies now offer similar high loan-to-value loans, so the Bank of England declared in September that the scheme is no longer necessary.

If so, email us at haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk. So far the Mortgage Guarantee scheme has cost the taxpayer a relatively small amount of money. Up to 30 September, only two home-owners had defaulted on their mortgages, meaning that the Treasury has had to pay out just Â£17,411 to compensate mortgage lenders. In the long run it has set aside a potential Â£12bn to pay out in compensation. With interest rates at record lows, default rates have also been minimal. However when interest rates eventually rise, more borrowers are likely to default on mortgage payments, so the Treasury may have to pay out more.

It means the compensation claims process, which has been suspended since a separate court ruling in December, should now be able to resume. BP said it was \"disappointed\" by the decision and mulling its legal options. It had argued at an earlier court hearing that some firms had filed fictitious spill claims. The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans voted 8-5 against BP. The court hearing was the latest in a long series held to determine who BP owes money to following the largest oil spill in US history. The oil giant will now have to decide whether to progress to the next legal stage, and take its case to the US Supreme Court. The explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig four years ago killed 11 workers, and pumped millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. In the latest ruling, Judge Leslie Southwick stated that a 2012 policy statement, issued by the court-appointed claims administrator and developed with \"input and assent from BP,\" clearly spelled out the criteria for business compensation claims. Mr Southwick said all parties agreed to the relevant criteria, before court approval of that 2012 settlement deal.

{"article": "The court acquitted 29 others in the case known as the Naroda Patiya massacre. Among those convicted were former minister Maya Kodnani and Babu Bajrangi, a former leader of the hardline Hindu group Bajrang Dal. A total of 95 people were killed in the rioting on 28 February in the Naroda Patiya area of Ahmedabad city. Most of the convicted, including Ms Kodnani and Mr Bajrangi, were found guilty of murder and criminal conspiracy, reports said. The trial began in August 2009 and charges were framed against 62 people. One of the accused died during the trial. Ms Kodnani was the junior minister for women and child development in the Gujarat government when she was arrested in connection with the incident in 2009. More than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed when riots erupted after 60 Hindu pilgrims died in a train fire in 2002. It was one of India's worst outbreaks of religious violence in recent years. Muslims were blamed for starting the train fire. Hindu mobs eager for revenge went on the rampage through Muslim neighbourhoods in towns and villages across Gujarat in three days of violence following the incident. The cause of the Godhra train fire is still a matter of fierce debate. A commission of inquiry set up in 2008 by the Gujarat state government determined that it was the result of a conspiracy. But a 2005 federal government inquiry concluded that the fire had been an accident - probably started by people cooking in one of the carriages - and was not the result of an attack. Gujarat's authorities have been accused of not doing enough to stop the riots. Narendra Modi, Gujarat's chief minister since 2001, has always denied any wrongdoing in connection with the riots but has never expressed any remorse or offered any apologies.

The mayor has the final say on major planning applications in London. Earlier, Sadiq Khan said the \"high quality and spectacular design\" would add to the capital's \"fantastic array of sporting arenas\". He continued: \"Having taken a balanced view of the application, I'm satisfied this is a high-quality and spectacular design which will significantly increase capacity within the existing site, as well as ensuring fans can have easy access from nearby transport connections. \"I'm confident this new stadium will be a jewel in London's sporting crown and will attract visitors and football fans from around the world.\" The plans include an elevated walkway from Fulham Broadway station, plus a £12m investment from the club in community activities, such as employment and skills training, as well as a contribution of £3.75m towards affordable housing in the borough. Chelsea FC said it was \"delighted\" with the decision. \"Following a review by mayor of London Sadiq Khan, we are delighted he has chosen to support the council's decision.\" Trizia Fiorellino, chair of the Chelsea Supporters Group, said: \"It's obviously fantastic news for us.

In comments made to the media on 13 May, Mr Haber, who is from Germany, said: \"We have a saying 'Start like a Turk and end like a German. But here it is the other way round'.\" His words were seen as deeply derogatory in Turkey, where ambassadors are not expected to disrespect Turkish culture. On Tuesday, Turkey's EU Minister Omer Celik accused Mr Haber of breaching basic rules of diplomacy by not honouring Turkey's values and its president. \"There are two rules any diplomat should know,\" Mr Celik told Turkish television while on a visit to Bratislava. \"First is respect for a country's values, and second is respect for that country's president.

The troubles in China have sent the prices of commodities such as oil and copper sliding. The falls have hit exporters of commodities, such as Brazil and Russia, particularly hard. The IMF's warning comes ahead of a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers in Ankara on Friday and Saturday. The IMF said that the problems could lead to \"much weaker outlook\" for global growth. However, the fund still expects the global economy to expand by 3.3% this year, slightly lower than 3.4% in 2014. The US is forecast to grow by 2.5%, up from 2.4% in 2014, the eurozone should expand by 1.5%, nearly double the 0.8% seen last year, while China should expand by 6.8%, down from 7.4%. The IMF called on China to keep reforming its economy despite the recent falls in the stock markets on the mainland. Chinese stock markets have been falling since mid-June and the government unexpectedly devalued the yuan on 11 August. Many believed the move was an attempt to make Chinese exports more competitive. However, US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew warned China against manipulating its currency to give its exporters an unfair advantage. \"We are going to hold them accountable,\" he told CNBC. The IMF is also concerned about the impact on global growth if the US Federal Reserve raises rates later this year. The Fed, which could decide to lift rates when it meets on 16 and 17 September, should keep its decisions \"data-dependent\", the Fund said. Analysts at Societe Generale said: \"The IMF clearly doesn't think raising rates against the modest global growth backdrop is a good idea.\" More broadly the IMF recommended that advanced nations should maintain very loose monetary policies and \"growth-friendly\" fiscal policies.

{"article": "Researchers at the Institute of Cancer Research say this may explain why some cancers return, many years after they appear to have been cured. They analysed a patient whose leukaemia returned after 20 years in remission. The findings may help scientists to root out these dormant cancer cells, wake them up and kill them. The study, published in the journal Leukemia, found that the cancer cells which 'woke up' in the patient after a period of two decades were similar to a group of cancer cells that pre-dated the original bout of the disease. Blood and bone marrow samples were taken from the patient when he was diagnosed with a rare form of leukaemia at four years old and compared to samples taken when he relapsed aged 25. Researchers identified a specific DNA mutation in cancer cells from both blood samples, in which two genes called BCR and ABL1 fuse together. They said this showed a common link between the original and the relapsing leukaemia. But they also found many new genetic changes had occurred in the cancer cells when the patient relapsed. This implies that cancer cells had become dormant, resisted chemotherapy and then 'woke up' after many years of rest. The cells may have survived because they were growing much more slowly than other cancer cells - and chemotherapy attacks rapidly dividing cells. Study leader Professor Mel Greaves, director of the Centre for Evolution and Cancer at The Institute of Cancer Research in London, said the research showed that cancer cells are cunning. \"It provides striking evidence of cancer evolution in action, with cancer cells able to lie dormant to avoid treatment, and then to accumulate new mutations capable of driving a new bout of disease. \"Blood stem cells regularly fluctuate between being dormant or 'asleep' and dividing very quickly, so it seems cancer cells are just borrowing this trick to avoid being killed by chemotherapy.\" Prof Greaves added: \"In future it might be possible to speed up the growth of these pre-cancerous dormant cells so that they can be targeted and killed using chemotherapy, to reduce the risk of relapse even further.\" Dr Matt Kaiser, head of research at Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research, said there were still too many children whose cancer returns. \"If we can build up a picture of what causes rare cases of late relapse and how we can detect and prevent it, we may be able to deliver more true cures for this terrible disease.\"", "question": "Scientists say they have found evidence that cancer cells can go to ' sleep ' , avoiding the @placeholder of chemotherapy , and then ' reawaken ' years later .", "option_0": "effects", "option_1": "brunt", "option_2": "achievement", "option_3": "loss", "option_4": "role", "label": 0}

Patients thought an ambulance was on its way when this was not true. Secamb has apologised and admitted proper processes were not followed during a time of \"high patient demand\". Last week it was revealed Secamb was being investigated over the pilot project in which the trust decided to transfer certain 111 calls to the 999 system, thus gaining up to 10 additional minutes to assess patients' conditions. As part of the pilot scheme from December 2014 to February, the trust transferred some calls between systems to reassess what type of advice or treatment patients needed and whether an ambulance was really required. The NHS England report said pressure and demand on all ambulance trusts across England last winter was unprecedented. It said Secamb introduced its pilot project because it was concerned about its ability to provide a safe service to patients with life-threatening illness and those who were severely ill. But the report said: Frances Russell, chair of patient's organisation Healthwatch West Sussex, said the cause of the \"incredible\" demand for services last Christmas and New Year led to the changes being made. \"I don't think anyone has got to the root cause,\" she said. \"I think its a whole range of issues and clearly poor decision making processes as well.\" NHS England has made a series of recommendations following its investigation, including that there must be complete transparency within Secamb.

He talked about being frightened of being killed going to the marketplace, and his concern for his six-month-old daughter. \"She makes me optimistic. When I look at her eyes I see a good future,\" he said. For years control over Aleppo has been split between the government-held west and rebel-held eastern neighbourhoods. Residents lack water and power, the UN says. Most live in government areas, but around 250,000 are thought to be in rebel-held areas. In July, government forces encircled the east, breaking rebels' supply lines. But opposition fighters struck back, reopening a corridor. Clashes on Sunday appeared to focus on areas near the rebels supply corridor, with monitors saying opposition fighters sent a truck bomb into a government held district. It may be an attempt by the fighters, made up of various rebel and Islamist groups, to secure their supply chain.

At the time of the claims, Ms Gladman was undertaking research for a Home Office pilot. But she found her findings about the scale of sexual exploitation in Rotherham were also met with denial. Previously, she has only spoken anonymously. \"What I didn't realise was just how many whistle-blowers there had been over the years and how many opportunities to change poor practice,\" she said. \"That has cost young people their health, their happiness and in some cases their lives.

{"article": "The 25-year-old eldest granddaughter of Emperor Akihito will become engaged to law firm worker Kei Komuro, also 25, whom she met while studying together. Japan's imperial law requires a princess to leave the royal family after marrying a commoner. The move is expected to reignite debate on royal succession, with the emperor also possibly abdicating soon. Ten things about Japan's emperor Princess Mako and Kei Komuro met in 2012 at a restaurant, when they were both studying at the International Christian University in Tokyo. The Imperial Household told local media that plans were under way for the princess's engagement. The engagement will only be official after a ceremonial exchange of gifts, local media said. Public broadcaster NHK said the wedding is expected to take place next year. Asked about their engagement plans, Mr Komuro on Wednesday was quoted as saying: \"Now is not the time for me to comment, but I want to speak at the right time.\" Yes, Princess Mako's aunt Princess Sayako married a commoner in 2005 - the first time a Japanese royal became a commoner. Her wedding to an urban planner for the Tokyo city government, was described as a low key event. And Sayako was left to adjust to her more humble surrounding. She moved into a one-bedroom apartment, had to learn how to drive, shop in a supermarket and buy furniture. Princess Sayako is the only daughter of Emperor Akihito. Emperor Akihito, 83, hinted last August that he wanted to stand down, saying his age could interfere with his duties. No Japanese emperor has abdicated for two centuries and the law currently does not allow it, but Japan is currently considering legal changes to allow the emperor to abdicate. However, the new legislation is expected to leave unchanged a males-only succession law - which has been at the centre of debate for many years. Because of that law there are only four heirs to the Chrysanthemum Throne: Akihito's sons Crown Prince Naruhito and Prince Fumihito, Prince Hisahito (Fumihito's son) and the emperor's younger brother, Prince Masahito. After news of Princess Mako's upcoming engagement broke, Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying: \"There is no change in our view to proceed with consideration of steps to ensure stable imperial succession.\"", "question": "A member of Japan 's royal family , Princess Mako , is to surrender her royal @placeholder by marrying a commoner .", "option_0": "status", "option_1": "debut", "option_2": "affected", "option_3": "inspired", "option_4": "motivated", "label": 0}

The opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC), said on Friday the safe zones plan lacked \"safeguards and compliance mechanisms\". It also said it did not accept Iran as a guarantor of the deal. The UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told the BBC the agreement was important because it was being implemented by three countries who could make it work.

The so-called \"memorandum on the creation of de-escalation areas\" was announced by the Russian military after talks in Kazakhstan's capital Astana. Russia's foreign ministry published the full text of the agreement on Saturday. The objective is to halt attacks by all sides and to \"provide the conditions for the safe and voluntary return of refugees\" in addition to the speedy provision of relief supplies and medical aid.

At least 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus died in the genocide. The BBC has denied that any part of the programme constitutes a \"denial of the genocide against the Tutsi\". On Wednesday, Rwandan MPs approved a resolution calling on the government to ban the BBC and to charge the documentary-makers with genocide denial, which is a crime in the country. Those killed in the genocide are generally believed to be mostly members of the minority ethnic Tutsi group, and Hutus opposed to the mass slaughter. The BBC programme Rwanda, The Untold Story, includes interviews with US-based researchers who say most of those killed may have been Hutus, killed by members of the then-rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which has been in power since 1994. The programme also included interviews with former aides of RPF leader President Paul Kagame, accusing him of plotting to shoot down the presidential plane - the act seen as triggering the slaughter. He has consistently denied previous such accusations. Rura said it had established a commission of inquiry to investigate the allegations it had received about the programme, after which further action may be taken. The cabinet is meeting next week to discuss parliament's recommendations.

The President's daughter, Gulnara Karimova, was one of the major players in non-state media, but in 2013 the authorities shut down several TV and radio stations associated with her after she fell from grace in an apparent power struggle. Uzbekistan has 687 newspapers, according to the Agency for the Press and Information. These include national dailies run by the executive and parliament, and titles published by the four official political parties, but no opposition newspapers are published. Uzbekistan has almost 12 million internet users (internetlivestats). Strict online censorship includes filtering at a central level. Targets include opposition and news websites. Many Uzbeks, especially young people, use Russian social media platforms, such as VKontakte and Odnoklassniki - the latter had 7 million registered Uzbek users by 2013. Politics is rarely discussed but social issues are raised more often and sometimes draw the attention of the authorities, such as in July 2014 when discussions about a hike in the price of sugar prompted officials to cap it.

{"article": "Bitcoin is a new type of money that is completely virtual. It's like an online version of cash. You can use it to buy products and services, but not many shops accept Bitcoin yet. The physical Bitcoins you see in photos are a novelty. They would be worthless without the private codes printed inside them. Each Bitcoin is basically a computer file which is stored in a 'digital wallet' app on a smartphone or computer. People can send Bitcoins (or part of one) to your digital wallet, and you can send Bitcoins to other people. Every single transaction is recorded in a public list called the blockchain. This makes it possible to trace the history of Bitcoins so people can't spend coins they do not own, make copies or undo transactions. There are three main ways people get Bitcoins. In order for the Bitcoin system to work, people can make their computer process transactions for everybody. The computers are made to work out incredibly difficult sums. Occasionally they are rewarded with a Bitcoin for the owner to keep. People set up powerful computers just to try and get Bitcoins. This is called mining. But the sums are becoming more and more difficult to stop too many Bitcoins being generated. If you started mining now it could be years before you got a single Bitcoin. You could end up spending more money on electricity for your computer than the Bitcoin would be worth. There are lots of things other than money which we consider valuable like gold and diamonds. The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money! Bitcoins are valuable because people are willing to exchange them for real goods and services, and even cash. Some people like the fact that Bitcoin is not controlled by the government or banks. That means there are no taxes or bank fees to pay, at least for now. People can also spend their Bitcoins fairly anonymously. Although all transactions are recorded, nobody would know which 'account number' was yours unless you told them. Every transaction is recorded publicly so it's very difficult to copy Bitcoins, make fake ones or spend ones you don't own. It is possible to lose your Bitcoin wallet or delete your Bitcoins and lose them forever. There have also been thefts from websites that let you store your Bitcoins remotely. At the moment the value of Bitcoins goes up and down a lot, so it's impossible to say whether it's safe to turn your 'real' money into Bitcoins.", "question": "Bitcoin is a new way of paying for things that is gaining @placeholder .

It also said the BBC would not be commissioning any new programmes from Sundog Pictures - an independent production company co-founded by Sir Richard Branson's son Sam - until further notice. Broadcast in January, Hidden Australia: Black in the Outback portrayed extreme drinking among the Aboriginal community as rife.

Refugee campaigners say it is a violation of international law. They say at least 11 of those on board had been tortured in Sri Lanka. Australia has been taking a tough approach on asylum seekers who try to reach the country by perilous sea journeys. Hundreds of would-be migrants have died trying to make their way to Australia by boat in recent years. The government has made no comment for what it says are \"operational reasons\" and will neither confirm nor deny the existence of the two boats carrying Tamils from Sri Lanka, says the BBC's Phil Mercer in Sydney. But Australian media say that some have already had their refugee claims rejected and have been transferred to the Sri Lankan navy, he adds. Forcing asylum seekers back to their country of origin without properly investigating their claims is a flagrant breach of the Refugee Convention and international law, the Refugee Council of Australia said. Chief executive Paul Power said: \"For asylum seekers, this is a matter of life and death, particularly in Sri Lanka which has a long history of political violence on a scale unimaginable to Australians.\" Ministers say, however, that Australia is upholding its international obligations. Tamil Refugee Council spokesman Aran Mylvaganam said he had spoken to relatives of some of those on the boats and that at least 11 had been arrested by Sri Lanka's intelligence forces \"and had been tortured\". The UN refugee council earlier this week expressed \"profound concern\" about Australia's handling of the asylum seekers. It has been six months since a vessel carrying refugees reached Australia after the military was called in to turn boats around. Under current Australian policy, most asylum seekers who try to make their way to Australia by boat are sent to detention camps in Papua New Guinea or Nauru. If found to be refugees, they will be resettled there, not in Australia. Australia says its asylum policy - which is also widely believed to involve towing back boats to Indonesian waters - is aimed at saving lives. Our correspondent says stopping refugee boats from reaching the country was one of the main campaign pledges of Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

{"article": "The decision by the eurozone central bank's 25-member governing council to leave its benchmark borrowing rate on hold had been expected. It was also decided not to change the ECB's bond-buying stimulus scheme, which was extended last month amid worries about economic growth. ECB head Mario Draghi said the eurozone economy is stronger, but still fragile. He told a news conference that deflation risks have \"disappeared\" and that economic surveys are positive. But this was no time for the ECB \"to relax\" and that the stimulus programme had to continue and even be increased if necessary. The 19-bloc eurozone still faces sluggish growth, and worries about the Italian banking crisis have intensified concerns about financial stability in the bloc. Last month, the ECB said it would extend its bond-buying until at least December 2017, but cut its purchases by â‚¬20bn a month. The â‚¬80bn-a-month quantitative easing (QE) scheme had been due to end in March. In a move that surprised markets, the ECB said it would only buy bonds worth â‚¬60bn a month from April. Mr Draghi said on Thursday: \"If warranted, to achieve its objective, the ECB will act by using all the instruments available within its mandate. \"In particular, if the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we stand ready to increase our asset-purchase programme.\" Some of the most recent economic data has been positive, and a jump in inflation across the bloc has allayed fears the eurozone may slip into deflation. But inflation is still just half of the bank's 2% target, and, Mr Draghi, was driven mostly by rising oil prices. \"Underlying inflation pressures remain subdued,\" he said. \"A very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is needed for euro area inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation in the medium term.\" His playing down of a faster rise in inflation saw the euro currency fall to a day's low against the dollar and a 10-day low against sterling.

This has led to trusts carrying forward an underlying deficit of £115m into 2014/15 However, only the Belfast trust broke even, as a result of the extra money it received. According to the auditor,  previous additional funding has \"masked\" rather than \"addressed\" underlying financial pressures. The report acknowledges that as continued reliance on additional funding is unrealistic, sustainable solutions to the increasing financial pressures must be found. With an ageing population the health and social services sector is likely to face further funding constraints in the future and can also expect to see a rise in demand for services. While it has been given some financial protection it is recognised that the financial health of the various bodies is weak and declining. The report says: \"In the face of rising inflationary cost pressures, demographic pressures from an increasing and ageing population and the pressures associated with new treatments and patient expectations while at the same time delivering a challenging programme of efficiency savings.\" The report also raises the issues of failed cancer treatment targets and tackling potential fraud. Hospitals failed to meet the 62-day target for cancer patients to start treatment. Overall, hospitals did not meet the target to ensure that 95%  of patients began their first cancer treatment within 62 days, following an urgent GP referral in any month during the two-year period to 31 March 2014. In the period under review, 446 negligence claims were settled costing more than £81m while the cost of 3,000 outstanding claims has been estimated at approximately £121m. While fraud was not identified by the report,   £5.7m of potentially inappropriate expenditure was found and this was sufficient evidence to proceed with disciplinary action. On the issue of transforming your care, the auditor is to examine how it is being managed in more detail.

A report on Wednesday said the public should be \"significantly reassured\", but some areas required more work. The health board said it was pleased and heartened by the findings. The original Trusted to Care report gave 14 recommendations, of which eight still need attention. It prompted Health Minister Mark Drakeford to instigate a series of unannounced spot checks at district general hospitals in Wales. The Trusted to Care 2015 review by Professor June Andrews and Mark Butler that followed, pointed to more work needed in the following areas: It said a clear deadline for delivery must now be set. However it praised Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABMU) for its \"excellent\" progress in addressing issues with making sure elderly patients are well fed, given water and have opportunities to be mobile. The board has also made progress on making sure enough staff work on elderly care wards, and was praised for \"exemplary action\" in relation to tackling the improper administration of sedation and medicines. Overall the report concluded the two hospitals \"continued to be exemplary in part\" and improvements have been made in the areas where previous serious failings occurred. However the authors warned: \"There remains variation in the patient experience between wards and services, especially at the Princess of Wales hospital\", and \"more needs to be done\" to improve standards and professional practices. ABMU chief executive Paul Roberts said: \"We hope that patients, their families and the public are now assured about the care we are providing. \"It would be a foolish health organisation that claimed the care it provided was always perfect. But we hope that not only are we now providing better care, but our improved systems will help us pick up issues much sooner, deal with them quickly, and better help us learn from mistakes.\" Mark Drakeford said he was pleased the report had found progress had been made, and he expected the board to continue the work.

Four of the seven suspects named by Malaysia work for Pyongyang's ministry of state security, intelligence officials in Seoul told MPs. It is unclear which of the North Koreans wanted by Malaysia were meant. Mr Kim died two weeks ago after two women accosted him in a check-in hall at the airport. They say they thought they were taking part in a TV prank. Mr Kim was given a very high amount of the toxic nerve agent VX and died in pain within 15-20 minutes, Malaysia's health minister said on Sunday. Who in North Korea could organise a VX murder? What is South Korea's take on the killing? Unravelling the mystery of Kim Jong-nam's death Malaysian police arrested a North Korean man named Ri Jong Chol a few days after the killing. Six other North Korean men have been named as suspects or are wanted in connection with the death. Four of them flew out of Kuala Lumpur airport shortly after the attack on Mr Kim, returning to Pyongyang via a complicated route that avoided China. The two other North Koreans named by Malaysian authorities are a senior official at the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur and an employee of the state airline, Air Koryo. While South Korea said on 19 February that it believed the North Korean regime was behind the death of Mr Kim, Malaysian authorities have not accused Pyongyang of carrying out the killing. North Korea has said that Malaysia is responsible for the death of one of its citizens and is attempting to politicise the return of his body.

He has lived abroad  for years and was bypassed in favour of his half-brother, Kim Jong-un. He had been travelling on a passport under the name Kim Chol. North Korea has yet to confirm that the deceased was actually Kim Jong-nam. For many years, it was believed Kim Jong-nam was being groomed to succeed his father as the next leader. But that appears to have come to an end in 2001 when Kim was caught sneaking into Japan on a fake passport.

The case will be closely watched by other traders who sell similar boxes. The trial will begin in May.

{"article": "Three appeal judges said they would take time to consider their decision. The court heard the case is significant as 2,000 women and girls travel to England for terminations every year. Unlike the rest of the UK, abortion is only allowed in very restricted circumstances in Northern Ireland. The 18-year-old woman was aged 15 when she made the journey in October 2012 with her mother. She was told she had to pay hundreds of pounds for a private termination because she was excluded from free abortion services. The teenager and her mother took their case to the High Court in London last year. However, in May 2014, the judge ruled that Northern Ireland women were not entitled to free NHS abortions in England. In his ruling, the judge said that devolutionary powers have to be taken into consideration. As Northern Ireland is not covered by the 1967 Abortion Act, which applies in the rest of the UK, the judge ruled this was not a discrimination issue. A barrister for the two women, known only as A and B to protect their identity, argued their appeal should be allowed because the High Court decision was legally flawed in a number of respects, and errors had been made on human rights issues. Backed by the Alliance for Choice organisation, which campaigns to extend legal abortion to Northern Ireland, he said the current situation was causing desperation and stress for the women and girls involved. The barrister said A had travelled to England with her mother and had a termination at a private clinic at the substantial cost of Â£900 because she was excluded from the NHS. He said they were a low income family who paid for the operation because of funds provided by a charity. \"We are looking at UK citizens who are in a position they should not find themselves in,\" he said.", "question": "The Court of Appeal has reserved judgement on a @placeholder by a young woman and her mother to a ruling that prevents women from Northern Ireland having free NHS abortions in England .", "option_0": "controversial", "option_1": "proposed", "option_2": "decision", "option_3": "plea", "option_4": "challenge", "label": 4}

Office development has slowed there since the 2008 property market crash. Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster said Invest NI would explore whether it can advance loans. This would be as \"a short-term intervention\". She said that this was likely to be mezzanine or equity finance made on commercial terms. Invest NI will seek expressions of interest from developers from 1 May to 31 August. Ms Foster said: \"The availability of suitable office accommodation is an important part of Northern Ireland's investment proposition. \"The report has shown that demand for Grade A office accommodation has remained relatively steady over the past three years but, with limited new development taking place, the supply has fallen. \"The lack of development may be due to constraints on bank lending to fund Grade A office space developments.\" The report, produced by consultants RSM McClure Watters, said \"very few\" developers have the capital required to build major projects. Low rental returns have also had an impact on the viability of schemes and their ability to attract bank funding. The report said there is \"clear justification for the consideration of public sector intervention... by reducing the financial risk of development\". Any intervention would be short-term and loans, probably only for up to a third of the costs, and would be repaid with interest. The money would come from a funding pot known as Financial Transactions Capital (FTC), outside Invest NI's budget and the block grant. But developers would still require other capital, either from banks or their own cash. Around 250,000 sq ft of Grade A space is said to be currently available. But agents forecast demand of 1.1m sq ft over the next three years.
