They were postponed because of an ongoing stalemate between the government and a group of opposition senators over an electoral law. Haiti is the poorest country in the region and is still struggling to recover from a 2010 earthquake. Protesters lit piles of wood in the central neighbourhood of Bel Aire before marching to a wealthy hillside neighbourhood, where riot police guarded hotels, shops and Haiti's elections office. Some demanded President Michel Martelly's resignation for his \"inability to organise elections in the country\". Two opposition activists who had organised the protest were arrested by police for \"public unrest and inciting violence\". Mid-term senate elections in Haiti had been due in May 2012, while the municipal poll is three years behind schedule as Haiti slowly emerges from the earthquake which left much of the country devastated in 2010. In June, President Michel Martelly decreed that the elections be held on 26 October. The date was set after lengthy talks mediated by the president of Haiti's Bishops' Conference, Cardinal Chibly Langlois, intended to overcome the political deadlock between the opposition and the government. But after the National Assembly failed to pass an electoral law in time, the office of Mr Martelly announced another postponement on Sunday. No new date has been set, but the statement said that \"President Michel Martelly, in his constant concern to guarantee political stability, promises to pursue consultations with the different sectors of national life in order to hold the elections as soon as possible\". Opposition politicians accuse President Martelly of wanting to rule by decree - a likely scenario if no elections are held before the lower chamber's term runs out in January.

Mr Manney then shot him 14 times, saying later that he feared for his safety. Mr Hamilton's family said he had suffered from schizophrenia and had recently stopped taking his medicine. His death triggered a series of protests in Milwaukee and Mr Manney was dismissed over the incident - a decision the former officer has appealed against.

Co-founder Julia Cordray told the BBC that users of the app will also be able to control which recommendations appear on their profiles. However, in April a premium service called The Truth License will enable those who choose the upgrade to see everything that has been said about other members, whether they have chosen to share those comments or not.

Nurse Helene Donnelly, who had given evidence to the public inquiry, told the Nursing and Midwifery Council hearing the two senior sisters had changed discharge documents and \"bullied\" other staff to do the same. She said: \"If I or my colleagues refused to change discharge times, Sister[s] Turner and White would shout, cold-shoulder and warn [that] the department could be closed.\" Ms Donnelly said Ms White had also badly treated patients and refused to help undress one elderly patient in A&E, describing her as a \"naughty monkey\".

Ms Donnelly said she had also witnessed patients being transferred out of A&E in soiled sheets, with dried faeces, at the insistence of sisters White and Turner, to meet a \"four-hour target\".  The hearing was told that failure to treat, discharge or admit patients within that time led to staff being reprimanded by managers. The hearing was told that Ms Turner, who no longer works at the hospital, often swore in front of patients and made comments about their weight. She is also accused of describing one Asian junior doctor as \"Osama's mate\" and asking him if he had a bomb in his rucksack. Ms Donnelly said senior managers must have been aware of changes to records, because of gaps in paperwork. The two senior sister are accused of falsifying hospital data and instructing others to do the same, making inappropriate comments about patients and staff, and transferring patients before they had properly assessed.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device Webber led after the final pit stops and the drivers were told to hold position to the end of the race but Vettel passed Webber after a tussle with 13 laps to go. Vettel has since apologised for the incident. Media playback is not supported on this device Lewis Hamilton took third ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, who obeyed an order to stay behind. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso crashed on the second lap after breaking his front wing. The Spaniard's team-mate Felipe Massa took fifth, fighting past the Lotus cars of Romain Grosjean and Kimi Raikkonen in the closing laps after the Lotus team's gamble to try to do only three pit stops rather than four failed. Grosjean finished sixth ahead of Raikkonen, who won the first race in Australia last weekend. McLaren's Jenson Button was on for a points-scoring finish, possibly in fifth place, before he was sent on his way from a pit stop with a loose front wheel. The Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg took eighth ahead of McLaren's Sergio Perez, with Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne 10th. It was a race full of drama as the intra-team battles at Red Bull and Mercedes played out live. \"The Malaysian Grand Prix team orders controversy at Red Bull is only the latest episode of a long-running drama between Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber. \"It goes right back to 2010, when the two crashed while Vettel tried to pass Webber for the lead of the Turkish Grand Prix. \"Since then, there has been a litany of further incidents at the team as the two men, both intensely determined and tough but very different in other ways, have battled for supremacy. \"Adding spice to it is Webber's belief that, while they profess to allow them to battle it out on the track, the team is more behind Vettel than him. \"The belief - widely shared within F1 - is founded on the way the team have responded to the various situations between their drivers. \"In their battle in Malaysia there may even have been a bit of residual revenge on Vettel's part - the German and his champion at Red Bull, motorsport chief Helmet Marko, felt Webber was obstructive in last season's title-deciding Brazilian Grand Prix.\" The battle between the Red Bulls was resolved in an intense scrap as Webber rejoined from his final pit stop. Vettel was warned by team boss Christian Horner that he was being \"silly\" but the two then battled wheel-to-wheel around Turns One and Two onto Turn Four, where Webber appeared finally to yield to his team-mate despite having the inside line. Webber said: \"After the last stop the team told me the race was over and we turned the engines down and go to the end. The team made their decision. Seb made his own decision and he will have protection as usual.\" Vettel was told over the radio after the race: \"Good job, Seb. Looks like you wanted it bad enough. Still you've got some explaining to do.\" Webber had initially taken the lead at the first stops as the drivers came in to fit dry-weather tyres following a wet start. He had led the race throughout, with the two Red Bull drivers using the two available tyre compounds in different orders. Vettel chose to end the race on the softer 'medium' tyre while Webber was on the hard. Vettel said: \"Obviously it is very hot and if there is something to say we need to say it internally.\" Red Bull motorsport chief Helmut Marko, a powerful champion of Vettel, admitted the battle had \"got out of control\". Meanwhile, there was controversy at Mercedes as Rosberg followed Hamilton closely in the final laps. Media playback is not supported on this device Rosberg asked the team to let him pass Hamilton, but was told \"negative\" by team boss Ross Brawn. When he complained again, Brawn told him that Hamilton - who had earlier been told to save fuel - was also being \"controlled\" and could also go faster. Hamilton admitted on the podium: \"I can't say it's the best feeling being up here today. If I'm honest I really feel Nico should be standing here.\" Hamilton had provided an amusing diversion when, coming in for his second stop, he headed into the pit box of former team McLaren before being waved on towards Mercedes. \"I did a Jenson,\" he said. \"He did it a couple of years ago and I've done it today. Apologies to my team.\" The result puts Vettel into the championship lead by 11 points from Raikkonen. Webber is five points further adrift and ahead of Hamilton, Massa and Alonso, who is already 22 points behind Vettel, the man who narrowly beat him to the title 2010 and 2012. Alonso started third and was up to second, past Massa, by the first corner. But he tapped the back of Vettel's car in Turn Two. It was the lightest of touches but enough to break the front wing mounts. He held onto second place throughout the first lap but did not stop to change it and it collapsed heading into Turn One on the second lap, sending him into the gravel trap. Ferrari said the decision not to stop was made in the pits. Alonso wrote later on Twitter: \"Bad luck today. As always over 19 races we will be compensated and we are ready to recover good points in the next race.\" Result: 1. Sebastian Vettel (Ger), Red Bull, 1hr 38min 56.681secs 2.

It has replaced the swing, which was being sold less, particularly during the winter, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The price movements of 700 goods and services are measured in 20,000 UK outlets to calculate inflation. Also added to the basket were gin, flavoured ciders, non-dairy milk (such as soya or almond), men's fitness tops, and jigsaw puzzles for adults. Gin comes back into the mix after a 13-year absence from the basket - the result of new craft distilleries popping up and rising popularity. Bicycle helmets also return to the inflation basket after a 12-year absence. Disappearing from the basket are alcopops, old mobile phone handsets, menthol cigarettes, and the fee for stopping cheques. The basket of goods reflects contemporary habits and technology to calculate the changing cost of living, as measured by the inflation rate. A series of changes have been made, but the replacement of the swing with the scooter is perhaps the clearest signal of how families have changed their habits regarding gifts for children. Officials at the ONS have decided scooters have moved on from being a fad to become everyday items.

Pilot Capt Carl Dickerson, 36, co-pilot Capt Lee Hoyle, 45, and foreman Declan Small, 42, also died in the 2014 crash. The inquest heard the fog was so thick RAF rescue crews could not land.

It did not in fact take off until 19:22 GMT as Dr Haughey oversaw renovations of Gillingham Hall, including selecting paint colours, decorator John Savage told the hearing. Flt Lt Ian Smith, an on-call RAF search and rescue pilot at Wattisham airfield, Suffolk, told a jury inquest in Norwich that he was sent to the scene of the crash. But even with night-vision goggles, radar and military training, his helicopter was unable to land because of low visibility, he said. He added: \"It was thick fog, we couldn't see anything below us.\" Barry Dolby, who was working at the house, watched the helicopter take off.

Mr Hollande is the first French president to visit Cuba since 1898, and the first Western European leader on the island since the 1980s. President Hollande and Fidel Castro spoke for an hour, according to Liberation journalist Laure Bretton who tweeted his comments (in French) after the meeting. \"I had in front of me a man who had made history,\" Mr Hollande told her. He later met Fidel's brother and current President Raul Castro. Speaking earlier on Monday at the University of Havana, Mr Hollande said France would do its utmost to ensure that \"the measures which have so badly harmed Cuba's development can finally be repealed\". He was referring to the US trade embargo, which remains in place, although relations between the US and Cuba have improved in recent months. The diplomatic thaw between Cuba and the US was announced in December. Mr Hollande announced plans to double the number of scholarships to enable Cuban students to continue their studies in France, as part of attempts to increase academic and scientific co-operation between the two nations. The president's first appointment on Monday morning was to bestow France's highest award, the Legion of Honour, on the head of the Catholic Church in Cuba, Cardinal Jaime Ortega. The Cuban Catholic Church has acted as a mediator between dissidents and the Communist government. The BBC's Will Grant in Havana says that unlike some other European countries, France has long maintained reasonably good relations with Cuba and wants to benefit from the new economic openness.

However, it noted the \"complex and sensitive\" issues dealt with and the \"new risks emerging\". It recommended the establishment of a national child protection leadership group, the development of a national child protection register, and a set of national standards for those undertaking significant case reviews. In a statement to MSPs, Mr McDonald said all 12 recommendations from the report would be taken forward. The new criminal offence would be an amendment to the Children and Young Persons (Scotland) Act 1937, the \"archaic\" wording of which Mr McDonald said was making it difficult to prosecute abusers. He told members: \"Catherine Dyer's review concludes that, in general, our child protection system works well. However, both she and the Child Protection Improvement Programme Report have identified opportunities to strengthen all aspects of the system to better protect our children. \"I have made clear where I expect to see improvements in Scotland's child protection system, particularly in relation to consistency of approach. \"If in a year's time there is little evidence of real and substantial progress then I will not hesitate to bring forward legislation to provide an appropriate statutory underpinning.\" During the subsequent questions, Scottish Conservative Miles Briggs raised the \"worrying trend\" of human trafficking, asking if there would be specific measures to tackle this. Mr McDonald replied that the government has a \"zero-tolerance\" approach to trafficking, and is raising awareness of the services available to victims. Labour's Iain Gray welcomed any progress towards protecting children, but raised concerns about the speed of \"what has been quite a lengthy process\".

Wprost's chief editor, Sylwester Latkowski, was being questioned on Tuesday as a witness in the inquiry after he resisted attempts to search the magazine's office and computers last week.

The US military has also trained elephants to sniff out explosives in the South African countryside. Now an Australian zoo is harnessing an elephant's smell for a more modest aim - improving his mood. Putra Mas, Perth Zoo's only male Asian elephant, has been trained to find particular scents hidden around his enclosure. The idea came after zookeepers noticed signs of boredom, which can affect the behaviourally complex animals in captivity. Unlike the zoo's two female elephants, Putra Mas's temperament prevented him from being walked around the grounds. So keepers tried to \"brighten his day\", said Peter Mawson, the zoo's director of animal health and research. Putra Mas was taught to identify scents including lemongrass, coffee, fur, feathers and animal urine. He would squeak with each discovery. Mr Mawson said the programme had been very successful. \"It's made a noticeable difference in the level of trust between our bull elephant and his keeping staff,\" he told the BBC. \"And he certainly seems to enjoy the game.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device Esquire has published three sets of data online, with a full story in the next edition of the magazine on Monday. The first set is from 2007, the second from this year's Tour and the third from August's independent tests. \"My hope is more transparency can be another small step in helping rebuild trust in the sport I love,\" he said. \"The deceit of the past still casts its shadow over the present,\" added the 30-year-old. Britain's Froome says he hopes releasing the data will \"satisfy some of the questions asked\". \"I know what I've done to get here. I'm the only one who can really know 100% that I'm clean,\" he said. \"I haven't broken the rules. I haven't cheated. I haven't taken any secret substance that isn't known of yet. \"I know my results will stand the test of time, that 10, 15 years down the line people won't say, 'Ah, so that was his secret'. There isn't a secret.\" The data from 2007 was collected by the sport's world governing body, the International Cycling Union, during the Kenya-born rider's stint at the World Cycling Centre, a programme for talented athletes from developing cycling nations. The UCI blood data is incomplete by today's standards, as it predates the introduction of the biological passport in 2009. Two key tests at that point - his VO2 Max and threshold power - indicate the type of rider who could win one of cycling's biggest races, provided he lost weight to improve his climbing ability. That is also the picture painted by the tests Froome had at the GSK Human Performance Lab (GSK HPL) in London in August. On that occasion his VO2 Max, which is the peak amount of oxygen an athlete can use, was 84.6 (ml/kg/min) - readjusted for his Tour weight, that it is 88.2, a number that supports the power data Team Sky released in July from his superb victory on stage 10 at this year's Tour. That \"data dump\" was an attempt by Froome's team to defuse what was becoming a toxic atmosphere at the race. GSK HPL's senior scientist Dr Phillip Bell described Froome's VO2 Max values as being \"close to what we believe are the upper limits for humans\". As well as his independent testing results, Froome has also given Esquire biological passport blood tests from 13 July, the day before that 10th stage win, and 20 August. The first sample shows Froome's haemoglobin level (the molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen) was 15.3 grams per litre, with 0.72% of his red blood cells being immature cells known as reticulocytes (produced by bone marrow in response to the body's needs). This produces an OFF-score, an equation used in anti-doping to indicate possible blood manipulation, of 102.1. The second sample shows haemoglobin of 15.3, with a reticulocyte count of 0.96%, and an OFF-score of 94.21. On their own, there is nothing about these scores that reveals anything untoward but, as British athlete Paula Radcliffe has recently discovered, they only provide a snapshot of what is happening at a particular moment and definitive proof that somebody is clean requires more data, recorded over time. That, however, is something that very few athletes have been willing or able to produce. Froome's former Team Sky team-mate Sir Bradley Wiggins told BBC Radio 5 live on Thursday his fellow Briton faced an almost impossible task in trying to convince everybody he is clean. \"I don't think [releasing his data] is going to change perceptions or what people think but at the same time that's what people have called for and he's done it,\" said Wiggins, who has also had to deal with speculation about his successes on the road - speculation he has dismissed. \"Hats off to him for doing it and I'm sure it's not going to be something that [he and Team Sky] are going to live and die by. \"I don't think it's going to change anything but it's a small step maybe.\" Froome first announced his intention to release the results of independent physiological testing during this year's Tour. As in 2013, his first victory, he was subjected to intense media scrutiny over the veracity of his performances, which spilled over into some deeply unpleasant scenes on the roadside. His team-mate and close friend Richie Porte was punched by a fan during one stage, Team Sky's cars were frequently pelted with drinks and rubbish by spectators and Froome himself was spat at and had urine thrown at him on one particularly ugly day. Froome told Esquire the accusations of doping did bother him - \"it's hard not to get angry\" - but denied they detracted from his joy at becoming the first British rider to win a second Tour title. \"Nothing is going to taint that for me,\" he said. \"All that stuff, it was an added challenge and did make it harder, but in a way it feels like an even greater achievement.\" Given what is known now about the sport's recent history of endemic doping, Froome added he understands why many cycling fans are so sceptical and accepts \"questions do need to be asked\". \"As long as the questions are fair, I'm happy to answer them,\" he said. The results of his testing at GSK HPL are expected to be published in an unspecified scientific journal at a later date, and Froome is also believed to be open to the idea of further testing in the future.", "question": "Chris Froome says he knows releasing physiological data will \" not convince everyone \" who @placeholder he twice won the Tour de France as a clean rider .", "option_0": "said", "option_1": "deserves", "option_2": "insisting", "option_3": "doubts", "option_4": "insists", "label": 3}

{"article": "The policy guarantees Thai rice farmers a much higher price than on the global market, but critics say it is too expensive and vulnerable to corruption. The commission has already charged one minister, and is investigating others. The news comes as Ms Yingluck already faces intense pressure to resign. Anti-government protesters have been marching through the capital, saying they will shut it down until their demands are met. They accuse her government of being under the control of her brother, ousted former leader Thaksin Shinawatra. They say they want an unelected \"People's Council\" instead, to reform the electoral system. The rice purchase scheme was launched in 2011, with the aim of boosting farmers' incomes and helping alleviate rural poverty. But it has resulted in the accumulation of huge stockpiles of rice, which the government cannot sell. The National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) says it is looking into Ms Yingluck's role in the scheme, and investigating her for possible negligence of duty. \"Those who oversaw the scheme knew there were losses but did not put a stop to it,\" NACC spokesman Vicha Mahakhun told a news conference. As prime minister, Ms Yingluck is nominally the head of the National Rice Committee. Farmers have traditionally been some of Ms Yingluck's most ardent supporters. Her Pheu Thai Party was helped to power in 2011 by offering to buy rice at above the market price. But the rice policy is thought to be costing Thailand around $10bn ( Â£6bn) a year - and the government has been unable to pay farmers for their most recent harvest, because a bond issue last year failed to raise sufficient funds. That could cost the government support from one of its most important constituencies, according to the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok. Farmers are already talking about marching on Bangkok in protest, he says. In addition, if the NACC finds Prime Minister Yingluck guilty, she could be banned from politics, along with other ministers. This would cast another shadow over the election she has called for next month, our correspondent says. The election is already proving contentious. The main opposition Democrat Party is boycotting the polls, which it fears will once again return the Shinawatra family to power. Anti-government protesters have also rejected the elections, demanding electoral reforms.

{"article": "The team at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology says its findings \"open up a whole new era\" in neurodegenerative disease. Their work should make it easier to design drugs to stop brain cells dying. The researchers used brain tissue from a 74-year-old woman who died after having Alzheimer's disease. The form of dementia leads to tangles of a protein called tau spreading throughout the brain. The more tau tangles there are, the worse the  symptoms tend to be. Doctors have known this has happened for decades but what has been missing is a detailed understanding of what the tangles look like. The team took advantage of the \"resolution revolution\" in microscopy to take thousands of highly detailed images of the tau inside the woman's brain tissues. And using computer software, they figured out the tangles look like this: It is pretty meaningless to an untrained eye, but to scientists this could be one of the most important recent discoveries in tackling dementia. Attempts to develop a drug to slow the pace of dementia have been met by repeated failure. But it is hard to come up with a drug when you do not know the precise chemical structure of what you are targeting. Dr Sjors Scheres, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: \"It's like shooting in the dark - you can still hit something but you are much more likely to hit if you know what the structure is. \"We are excited - it opens up a whole new era in this field, it really does.\" Rules of memory 'beautifully' rewritten Experts excited by brain 'wonder-drug' Similar dysfunctional proteins are found in many brain diseases.

Fellow researcher Dr Michel Goedert told the BBC: \"This is a big step forward as far as tau goes but it is bigger than that. \"This is the first time anybody has determined the high-resolution structure [from human brain samples] for any of these diseases. \"The next step is to use this information to study the mechanisms of neurodegeneration.\" Dr Tara Spires-Jones, from the centre for cognitive and neural systems at the University of Edinburgh, said the findings \"substantially advance what we know\".

Open Road, which distributed the film, has now acknowledged Mr Dunn actually sought to help victims of abuse. \"We acknowledge that Mr Dunn was not part of the archdiocesan cover-up,\" it said in a statement. Fabricated dialogue in the movie made it appear as if Jack Dunn, a former student and spokesman for Boston College, had downplayed the extent of the Catholic priest sex abuse scandal. The scene Mr Dunn appears in was based on an interview with reporters that occurred at Boston College High School in 2002 after the school was informed that three former teachers had abused students during the 1970s. At one point in the scene, Mr Dunn, portrayed in the film by actor Gary Galone, says: \"It's a big school, Robby. You know that. And we are talking about seven alleged victims over, what, eight years?\" The on-screen character later says: \"This is ridiculous. You are reaching for a story here.\" Mr Dunn, who is still a trustee of Boston College High School, had threatened legal action against makers if the scene portraying him was not removed.

{"article": "Well, that might not be strictly true. Players combine some welcome down time following the hectic festive schedule with some training to keep themselves ticking over. But what about those who don't kick a ball in anger all year round? We asked them, and a player, for their views... On the merits of the shutdown \"It's too early to say from a Ross County perspective. Commercially, probably for a football club to shut for three weeks isn't a good thing. I'm also aware that some of our players had very little time off in the summer. At this stage of the season, you wonder whether burnout becomes a factor. \"It will probably take until the end of the season to evaluate whether it's a worthwhile exercise or not.\" Does the winter break affect your work as a chairman? \"At a football club, during the breaks where there's no football there's always more work to do, particularly in the summer as you prepare for a new season. Even at this stage of the season - because the season goes through to the middle of April - there's the split and you've got to prepare for the last five games and sell hospitality and that sort of thing. There's a lot of preparation behind the scenes and it's a time for recharging batteries for commercial and hospitality people. \"I'm talking to the manager every week of the year about how he improves the team; it doesn't really change dramatically during this period. I don't think the winter transfer window is one where there's a huge amount of activity. \"Planning more for the summer is more important. \" Is the winter shutdown long enough? \"I'm not quite sure because again it goes back to the question of summer football and whether you extend the season back into June, and how does that affect Scotland and school holidays and other things people have been doing for a good number of years in the summer. \"It goes back to the summer argument; I don't have a particular view either way. I think the experiment with the League Cup and taking it back into the middle of July - that's been good. It'll be interesting to see how people have viewed that at the end of the season and whether they want to take the season back even earlier. I have an open mind on it.\" Are you happy for the shutdown to happen every season? \"I've got an open view as this has been a funny season. With World Cup qualifiers, we've had four Saturdays where we haven't played football. So, we've had more midweek games. We find it difficult to get people [fans] in for a midweek game compared to Saturdays. I would like to hear the argument both ways. But I do think that our players who play 48, 49 or 50 weeks of the year are probably playing too much. \"We need to look at how we get the best out of players so that they can perform for, say, 40 weeks a year. That's more important. How that's divvied up? I've got an open mind and I'd like to hear the debate, from experience and also a supporter's point of view. \"Supporters play a bit part in this as well. Ultimately, without people coming to the football we don't have football. Supporters have a big say in whether they want summer football or the winter break. In Scotland, football has traditionally been played during the Christmas and New Year period. In Spain and other countries they don't do it.\" \"I kind of enjoy the winter break just after a busy and an expensive time for everybody. It gives the fans' pockets a break at an expensive time of year. Scottish football is very expensive - you're talking £20-25 for a ticket, £10 travel depending on where we are going and then all the other stuff that goes with it - so if you've got games Wednesday-Saturday it helps the supporters in that sense. \"On this occasion it might just actually suit Hearts to do that. It means that [new head coach] Ian Cathro and [assistant] Austin McPhee can spend some time with the players getting their ideas over. It's maybe harder putting them into practice in a game situation but it gives them time to work with the players and get to know them a bit better, and maybe get their type of player in as well to fit the system they want us to play.\" Thoughts of other Hearts fans? \"It's 50-50. Some diehard fans will want the football every week. Others are a wee bit similar to myself, they feel the break comes at a good time. The slight issue is when we have it driven by the weather, there's no guarantees in Scotland that the weather will be bad in January and good in February. It's hard for anyone to call that one. \"These days I'm more inclined to go towards summer football which was something I was always dead against until recent times, but I think it would help make our football better. Players playing in better conditions.\" Is there a fly in the ointment? \"My concern about it is - the Premiership teams are coming back to join the Scottish Cup. It's their first game back. A few years back I seem to remember a few top-flight clubs were falling at the first hurdle in the Scottish Cup because we were coming back and playing teams from what's now the Championship who were all fully match fit.\" \"I'm 100% a fan [of the shutdown]. At this time of year, the chance for us to have a little bit of time to unwind and recharge, I think from a players' point of view there'd be few complaining, to be honest.\" Should the winter break be longer? \"I suppose time will tell. If you turn up on that first game back and there's a blizzard and games are called off, I'm sure there'll be some grumblings but to me three weeks seems sensible at this point. We got a week off away and I think that was probably about right. \"Now we have a couple of weeks to get back into training and ready for games. Hopefully you'll get a set of recharged players ready to go and have a good second half of the season.\" If clubs are on a good run of form, some say the break ruins their momentum… \"I can understand it from that point of view. We'd had a couple of good results away from home up at Inverness and then a last-minute draw against Hamilton with 10 men, which felt like a victory, so maybe you want to kick on, but I think when you look at the bigger picture most people would look on [the break] favourably. The positives outweigh the negatives and I hope it's here to stay. \"You might think the fans will say they miss the football but maybe that's part of the point. Hopefully it'll recharge their enthusiasm for it.\" The first game back is in the Scottish Cup - that means some clubs are facing opposition who've not had a break… \"That argument can work both ways. We'll be going into the Rangers game [in the Scottish Cup] with a fully fit squad, which is very rare at this time of year. So I think you'd certainly be grateful for that.\" \"Mentally and physically, I think it's good for the players to get a little break. It's been a tough season so far, a lot of tough games and they sometimes need that little break, then get them back working again, and get the freshness. \"I do think the break is maybe not long enough - maybe another week or two would help us a little bit more. But I think it'll help us in the second half of the season.\" Why weren't Dundee able to get away during the break? \"Our budget doesn't let us go away for a break abroad, so we've had to find one or two games here, and it's not easy trying to get teams at this stage in the season. Most of the other teams are playing - Championship, League One, League Two - so we've had to look at our training schedule and tried to fit a couple of games in. \"We've managed to fit one in; we hoped we'd have another but we've not managed. \"I would have liked to have taken the players away into a different environment, different training facilities. We're always finding it a little bit difficult - especially this time in the season with the weather - to find decent training facilities. \"We've had to go indoors this week on a six-a-side pitch which is not ideal in terms of our preparation. I would have liked to have taken the players away but the budget just doesn't let me do that.\" Could it disrupt momentum? \"We won two out of our three games over that [festive] period so we would have liked to have continued to play. But the players have been nice and fresh this week, it was nice for them to get out of this environment, spend time with their families, go away if they wanted to, and then recharge the batteries a little bit, because it's going to be a tough second part of the season for us.\" Should the winter shutdown return? \"I would want it next year - but maybe just a bit longer and not be thrown into a Scottish Cup game when you come back. We play St Mirren, who've been playing every week, so they'll be up to speed. \"I'd like it to stay - maybe add on an extra week and have that whole month off.\"", "question": "The winter shutdown @placeholder those who follow - or feature - for Scottish Premiership clubs the chance to put their metaphorical feet up for three weeks and recharge the batteries .", "option_0": "allowed", "option_1": "remain", "option_2": "insist", "option_3": "maintained", "option_4": "offers", "label": 4}

Tomorrow is also the 750th anniversary of the de Montfort parliament convoked by Simon de Montfort, the first nobleman to seize power and govern the country. It is seen as the first English parliament as it was the first with a house of commons to which knights from the counties and burgesses from the towns were summoned. Historian Professor David Carpenter notes that de Montfort may have opposed King Henry III under the umbrella of \"England for the English\" even though he wasn't English himself. There was also a strong Welsh dimension to his power grab. Prof Carpenter told me: \"One of the bases of Montfort's power was his alliance with Llywelyn who was very soon to be recognised as prince of Wales. In fact Montfort himself, very soon after the parliament, affirmed that alliance with Llywelyn by actually recognising him as just that, recognising him as prince of Wales and that laid the foundation for the later treaty of Montgomery in which King Henry III did the same. \"The result was there was a very, very large contingent on Montfort's side at the final, fatal battle of Evesham and as they marched out of Evesham this Welsh contingent of footsoldiers let out a great shout which shook the heavens. And for many of them it was the last shout of their lives because they were then massacred in the battle in which Montfort himself was also gruesomely killed.\" The BBC is today marking the 750th anniversary of the de Montfort parliament in what we are calling \"Democracy Day\".

At the weekend the HDP and other pro-Kurdish groups called for self-rule in Turkey's mainly Kurdish south-east. Turkish prosecutors have launched an investigation into those comments. The Turkish military has stepped up operations against the rebel Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is fighting for Kurdish self-rule. The army says it has killed more than 200 PKK militants in the latest fighting. The PKK is regarded as a \"terrorist\" organisation by Turkey, the US and EU. The HDP won 59 seats in Turkey's 550-seat parliament in the 1 November elections. It came third, behind Mr Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the Republican People's Party (CHP). Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Erdogan said Mr Demirtas and other Kurdish leaders would be \"taught a lesson\" by the people and the law. He accused Mr Demirtas of challenging Article 14 of the constitution, which bans activities deemed to \"violate the indivisible integrity of the state\". On Sunday Mr Demirtas backed a declaration by a Kurdish umbrella group - the Democratic Society Congress (DTK) - which called for \"autonomous regions\" and \"self-governance bodies\". After 30 years of fighting between Turkish security forces and PKK militants, there has been little progress on the Kurdish issue. The AKP has taken some steps towards improving the cultural rights of the Kurds, including on the official use of the Kurdish language, during its 13-year rule. But many of the Kurds' demands, such as the right to an education in Kurdish, have not been met. Self-rule has been discussed for decades. The idea is now being promoted by a legitimate political party, the HDP, and the umbrella organisation DTK. But with the recent upsurge in fighting in Turkey's mainly Kurdish south-east - with government-imposed curfews and Kurdish militias fighting in the streets - there is little room to talk about rights. The declaration, issued in the mainly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir, said the \"rightful resistance\" of Kurds against Turkish state policies \"is essentially a demand and struggle for local self-governance and local democracy\".

Dylan - who has sold more than 125 million records around the world and won multiple Grammys - called it \"a real privilege\" to make the album. \"I've wanted to do something like this for a long time but was never brave enough to approach 30-piece complicated arrangements and refine them down for a five-piece band,\" he said. \"That's the key to all these performances. We knew these songs extremely well. It was all done live. Maybe one or two takes. No overdubbing. No vocal booths. No headphones. No separate tracking, and, for the most part, mixed as it was recorded.\" Columbia Records chairman Rob Stringer said Dylan had infused \"new life and contemporary relevance into the songs\". \"There are no strings, obvious horns, background vocals or other such devices often found on albums that feature standard ballads,\" added Stringer. The album is the first new music from Dylan since 2012's critically acclaimed Tempest. His last five albums, including 2006's Modern Times, have achieved new levels of commercial success for his work.

{"article": "The drones can \"print\" a sticky foam on dangerous objects before attaching themselves and lifting the hazard away. The engineers hope that the drones will one day be capable of printing nests in treetops to enable them to rest and recharge before continuing. But one roboticist is unconvinced about the device's 3D-printing capabilities. Dr Mirko Kovac, director of the aerial robotics laboratory at Imperial College London, has been working on the project with a small team. In a video demonstration, a quadcopter (a drone with four rotors) can be seen printing a sticky foam substance onto a small block, before flying away. A hexacopter (which has six rotors) then takes the quadcopter's place, landing on the sprayed object and waiting for the foam to set. Then the hexacopter flies off, with the foreign object attached to its underbelly. The researchers hope this process will be particularly useful for removing hazardous materials, such as nuclear waste. According to the New Scientist, the quadcopter acts almost entirely autonomously and is guided by GPS. The foam is said to be made of polyurethane. The project's abstract states that potential applications could include \"ad-hoc construction of first response structures in search-and-rescue scenarios,\" as well as \"printing structures to bridge gaps in discontinuous terrain\". Thomas J Creedy, a PhD student working on the project at Imperial College London, said in a statement: \"This is an exciting first step in the lab's development of co-operative robotic systems for building structures inspired by the natural world.\" The robots are said to be inspired by swiftlets - birds that construct nests using their saliva. Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at the University of Sheffield, told the BBC he was not impressed with the 3D-printing capabilities but had high hopes for its future potential. Having seen the video presentation, Prof Sharkey said: \"This could hardly be called 3D printing, although it uses some of the components. \"However, the potential game changer in this application is their notion of using it to repair bridges and other construction works from the air.\" On 24 June, 3D printing firm Deezmaker and aerial photography company Velocity Pigeon teamed up to create a less advanced flying 3D printer, which they claimed was a \"world first\".

His contract entitled him to the cash reward for finishing the 2012-13 season. Critics of the New Jersey university say Mr Rice should have been fired when administrators first saw the video last year. In his resignation letter, Mr Pernetti said he hoped his tenure at Rutgers would \"not be judged by this one incident\". The 42-year-old added that when he first saw the video, his \"first instincts... was to fire him immediately\". However, he said the consensus at the time was \"university policy would not justify dismissal\". In an earlier statement, Mr Pernetti said that it had been his decision to \"rehabilitate\" Mr Rice, \"but I was wrong\". The footage, shown for the first time publicly on sport broadcaster ESPN on Tuesday, was shot during team practices between 2010-12. Mr Rice is seen shouting homophobic slurs, hurling balls at players, kicking, pushing and grabbing them.

{"article": "There are thought to have been as many as 200m downloads of period tracking apps worldwide. But a leading UK medical royal college has warned that women should not rely on them as a form of contraception. And privacy campaigners say users should be wary of what data they might unwittingly be sharing when they download some apps. A search for period tracking apps will quickly bring up dozens of offerings - some with charts, others illustrated with pink tulips or lilac flowers. In the health and fitness category, period trackers come second only to apps which monitor running. Amy Worsfold, from Greenwich, south-east London, has used different trackers for three years. She is a soprano opera singer. Amy told me: \"When you are starting your period or you're pre-menstrual, the hormones that rush around your body affect your larynx in ways that are detrimental to your singing voice. \"I use the app to avoid auditions, premieres or really important performances on those days if I can.\" She plots and predicts her cycle on her smartphone. The app also helps her identify connections with changes in her emotions, eating habits and headaches. Amy added: \"Being able to chart what happens to you and how you uniquely respond to your cycle is a great way of taking ownership of something that really sucks - but is completely necessary.\" Sometimes women download period trackers to monitor their fertility. But the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has warned they should not be used as a form of contraception. Only one such app on the market has been independently evaluated for effectiveness in this area. Generally, they are not classed as medical devices, which would involve stricter regulation. Ida Tin is the Berlin-based Danish entrepreneur behind an app called Clue. Around 10% of her market is in the UK. She said: \"I wanted to develop the next generation of technology for family planning - and I do believe we'll get there. But we're not there yet.\" Women in Mexico and Brazil have recently shown huge interest in Clue, possibly because of fears about getting pregnant during the Zika virus outbreak. Ida Tin is interested in how anonymised user data from her free app can be used for the greater good. To this end, she is collaborating with medical researchers at Oxford University. She has built her business on a responsible approach. She added: \"The app is a very powerful tool. I can't do what our users want me to do unless I use their data. \"I appreciate I'm asking people for a lot of trust in me, but a lot of companies [in the same line of work as mine] don't honour that trust.\" Some apps which are more firmly pointed at conception have a clear value to advertisers - as a woman planning a baby is a potential market for prams, clothing and many other purchases. Sam Smith is a privacy campaigner at medConfidential. He said: \"For all medical apps, but especially for conception apps, there needs to be a source people can trust that's independent and says this app is safe for you. \"You can read the terms and conditions - and legally you are required to. But everybody knows that nobody does.\" He sees the lack of regulation, or even official recommendation, as a market failure in this area.

The industry is under pressure since a diesel emissions scandal exposed cheating to manipulate test readings. Talks continued after the deal was announced, a source told Reuters. The deal was struck at a summit in Berlin. It was approved by Daimler, BMW, Volkswagen and Opel, VDA said in a statement (in German).

Shortly after the deal was announced, a source close to the negotiations told Reuters that talks between several cabinet ministers, regional premiers and car bosses were still going on at group level.

According to Variety, the actor \"gives expressive voice to [a] sensitive human being imprisoned in his own body\". The Hollywood Reporter's critic agreed, calling Cooper \"tremendously moving\". According to The Independent, the 39-year-old's work, together with his performance in upcoming Iraq war drama American Sniper, \"confirms [his] acting ascendancy is merited\". \"What he brings to this production is the weight of years of being stared at as an adult,\" wrote Ben Brantley in the New York Times. The role of John Merrick is an important one for Cooper, who has often spoken of how John Hurt's performance in Lynch's film inspired him. \"When I saw the Elephant Man movie that David Lynch directed when I was a kid, it solidified my need to become an actor,\" he told the BBC last year. Cooper, who was Oscar-nominated for his roles in Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle, previously played Merrick at the 2012 Williamstown Theatre Festival in Massachusetts. The Broadway staging of that production, wrote David Rooney in the Hollywood Reporter, gives \"ample evidence of Cooper's personal connection to the material, which goes far beyond technical craft to a place of wrenching empathy\". According to USA Today, Cooper \"approaches [the role] with total commitment, not only to reflecting Merrick's physical challenges but also to capturing the character's great sensitivity and wit\". Yet while the actor's \"bravura acting\" drew praise in Time Out New York, its reviewer felt it did not stop Bernard Pomerance's play being a \"clunky chestnut\".

Mrs Powell said despite the early infatuation the relationship became off-on, and her 26-year-old daughter finally ended it when she discovered Mr Nava had been unfaithful while she was pregnant with his child. In a statement, Mrs Powell said her daughter once admitted she was \"frightened\" when she realised Mr Nava had problems with alcohol.

After the split, the court heard Miss Wake remained friends with Mr Nava and he visited their child regularly, with him sometimes staying at her home, but Mrs Powell said her daughter was trying to \"move on with her life\".

His intervention - which puts him at odds with a number of his MPs - was criticised by a shadow cabinet member. The frontbencher said there would be resignations if Mr Corbyn ordered the shadow cabinet to back his stance. Labour is divided on whether to support Mr Cameron's call for air strikes, with about half of the shadow cabinet believed to back intervention. Mr Corbyn's decision to write to MPs before the shadow cabinet had reached agreement was criticised by a senior shadow minister, who told BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith: \"There will be resignations among senior members of the shadow cabinet over this.\" He said Mr Corbyn's letter had led to a breakdown of trust within the shadow cabinet, which had not been consulted before it was sent. A British serviceman would be \"insulted\" by Mr Corbyn's \"ridiculous party games\" he said, adding: \"We are becoming a complete joke.\" Shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn had earlier told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg he found the case for strikes \"compelling\". Downing Street sources said: \"It's not a great surprise that Jeremy Corbyn has come out against air strikes. The issue is how many Labour MPs feel able to support him.\" Shadow international development secretary Diane Abbott told Channel 4 News Thursday's shadow cabinet meeting had been \"lively\". She said 70% of Labour members were against air strikes, but that some MPs \"seem to have been persuaded by David Cameron\". After \"a weekend's reflection\", she predicted, these MPs would \"see things differently\". Momentum, the grass roots organisation formed by Corbyn supporters after his leadership victory, has emailed Labour members urging them to lobby their local MPs to oppose air strikes. The Labour row comes after Mr Cameron spent nearly three hours trying to convince MPs action against IS in Syria would make Britain \"safer\" and would be part of a \"comprehensive\" strategy alongside key allies to defeat the group. He told MPs the UK was already a target for IS and could not \"outsource our security to allies\". The prime minister said he would only hold a Commons vote authorising action if he was certain he could win it - which would depend on persuading Labour MPs to back him. The vote could come as soon as next week, with former Tory rebels and some Labour backbenchers indicating they now backed action. Speaking on BBC Question Time, former London mayor Ken Livingstone, recently appointed onto Labour's defence review team, said he suspected its MPs would be given a \"free vote\" on Syria, meaning they would not be forced to follow a party line. Labour's shadow cabinet met after Mr Cameron's statement and Mr Corbyn said it would continue trying \"to reach a common view\" on Syria on Monday. But in his letter to MPs, he said: \"We've all been horrified by the despicable attacks in Paris and are determined to see the defeat of ISIS. \"Our first priority must be the security of Britain and the safety of the British people. The issue now is whether what the PM is proposing strengthens, or undermines, our national security. \"I do not believe that the PM today made a convincing case that extending UK bombing to Syria would meet that crucial test. Nor did it satisfactorily answer the questions raised by us and the Foreign Affairs Committee. \"In particular, the PM did not set out a coherent strategy, coordinated through the UN for the defeat of ISIS. Nor has he been able to explain what credible and acceptable ground forces could retake and hold territory freed from ISIS control by an intensified air campaign. \"In my view, the PM has been unable to explain the contribution of additional UK bombing to a comprehensive negotiated political settlement of the Syrian civil war, or its likely impact on the threat of terrorist attacks in the UK. \"For these, and other reasons, I do not believe the PM's current proposal for air strikes in Syria will protect our security and therefore cannot support it.\" Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond earlier said he believed the government was building a consensus for military action.

{"article": "Final approval was given by a committee chaired by President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi following two weeks of talks with delegates from across the country. The federal structure should be enshrined in a new constitution that must be put to a referendum. The move is intended to end the complaints against centralisation that fed rebellions in the north and south. Yemen has also been struggling to deal with the unrest sparked by a 2011 popular uprising that forced long-time President Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down, and an insurgency by Islamist militants allied to al-Qaeda. President Hadi formed the committee to decide Yemen's new structure in late January following the completion of the National Dialogue Conference, created under the Gulf Co-operation Council-brokered agreement that led to Mr Saleh's departure. Delegates at the NDC agreed to create a decentralised, federal system, and to reverse the political and economic marginalisation that southern Yemenis had suffered since unification in 1994. On Monday, state news agency Saba reported that the presidential committee had voted overwhelmingly in favour of dividing the country into six federal regions - two in the south - Aden and Hadramawt - and four in the north - Saba, Janad, Azal and Tahama. The capital, Sanaa, would be a \"federal city not subject to any regional authority\" and the constitution would \"guarantee its neutrality\", it said. The port city of Aden would also have a special status and be given \"independent legislative and executive powers\", Saba added. Many politicians from the south had called for a federation of two regions. They argued that it would put them on a more equal footing with the north while securing their access to a larger share of the country's oil resources, which are located in the south. Southern leaders swiftly rejected Monday's announcement. \"What has been announced about the six regions is a coup against what had been agreed at the dialogue,\" Mohammed Ali Ahmed, a former South Yemen interior minister who returned from exile in March 2012 and withdrew from the NDC in November, told the Reuters news agency. Nasser al-Nawba, a founder of the separatist Hiraak al-Janoubi (Southern Movement), meanwhile vowed that it would continue what he described as its peaceful struggle until independence was achieved.", "question": "Yemen is to become a federation of six regions as part of its political @placeholder , state media report .", "option_0": "losses", "option_1": "strategy", "option_2": "secret", "option_3": "transition", "option_4": "analysis", "label": 3}

The singer's first album in a decade became the fastest-selling of the year earlier this week. The Next Day is the 66-year-old's first number one since 1993's Black Tie White Noise. Although Bowie is not directly involved with curating the V&A exhibition, the David Bowie Archive gave the London museum \"unprecedented access\" to pick out flamboyant costumes, early photographs and other memorabilia. On display will be more than 60 stage-costumes including Ziggy Stardust bodysuits (1972) designed by Freddie Burretti, Kansai Yamamoto's flamboyant creations for the Aladdin Sane tour (1973) and the Union Jack coat designed by Bowie and Alexander McQueen for the Earthling album cover (1997). Personal items such as handwritten set lists and lyrics, as well as some of Bowie's own sketches, musical scores and diary entries will also be shown. Bowie's innovative approach to creating albums and touring shows centred around fictionalised stage personas, with 1972 marking the birth of his most famous creation Ziggy Stardust - a human manifestation of an alien being. Ziggy's androgynous and otherworldly appearance had a powerful influence on pop culture and signalled a challenge of social traditions.

The maiden flight of the Supermarine Spitfire took place on 5 March 1936, from Eastleigh Aerodrome, now Southampton Airport. Mr Costain described flying a Spitfire as \"absolutely marvellous\". He said: \"When you first got into the seat and opened the throttle it felt as if someone had given you a good kick up the bottom and away you went. \"It would do everything you asked of it. Compared to other aircraft it was light on the controls, you could do all the aerobatics and you would come up to speed very quickly. \"If you treated a Spitfire properly, it treated you properly. Treat it roughly or be careless with it and you were in trouble, in that it would do all sorts of things such as ground looping. It also had a very fragile undercarriage and could collapse.\" Mr Costain was a member of the RAF for 37 years. He flew operational Spitfires over Europe, north Africa, the Middle East and Burma. He was also a Spitfire instructor during that time and became a test pilot on Spitfires at 9MU Cosford, Shropshire. He said: \"Everyone that joined the air force wanted to fly a Spitfire. \"I would say that I have flown nearly all of the operational Spitfires. \"There aren't many of us left [alive] that have flown the number of different marks of Spitfire that I have.\" During and since his flying days, Mr Costain says he has often been asked if he was frightened during the war years. He said: \"I was terrified, but I was terrified of letting my own friends see that I was frightened. One made one's self very determined that you wouldn't show that. \"If you were attacked when you were flying a Spitfire during the war years, you turned hard into the attacking aircraft and they just couldn't get behind you!

{"article": "None of the academics themselves thought that the mere act of heading a normal football a number of times, at a normal speed, as if in a normal situation, would give rise to an immediate reduction in brain function, and the onset memory loss, in the brains of two thirds of the participants tested. Disturbingly the symptoms took 24 hours to clear. The question that popped into my head was: what if someone does this every day? Do they live a life in a permanently sub concussive state? How does this affect them in older life? What about youngsters whose brains are more prone to damage? Oh we know about concussions, but we thought the days of heading an old, sodden, leather football were gone. We know about elbows and head knocks, and we know about footballers and rugby players with early onset dementia. But we didn't know that just heading a ball caused so much damage to the brain. As I looked on slightly alarmed, a student footballer sat strapped to a chair in the shiny white laboratory of the Cottrell building on the leafy Stirling university campus. Outside the trees tried to discard their summer green for the stunning autumn gold, but the subject's face clung on to the olive tones of someone more than slightly nervous. Wires led from his body to a machine measuring his brain's ability to react to a stimulus and transfer it to his leg muscles. To my left was a wavy line on a screen that couldn't lie. The test was a mock-up for our filming, but the source signals going through his brain and to the machine were real and each one came with a crack, a two-eyed blink, a violent contraction of his quadricep, and a tell-tale jump in the trace signal on that all knowing screen. Putting students through this before and after headers demonstrated the immediate effects I mentioned earlier. I played rugby, I have a son who plays rugby, and a daughter who plays international football. I hope beyond hope that this test doesn't mean I have been a fool to encourage both of them into sport. But this, of all the research I have seen, is the piece of work that alarms me the most. More and more research is pointing to the fact that the bit of my body I was least worried about hurting by taking up sport - my brain - might just have been the most vulnerable after all.

Last week, the Dow Jones in the US fell 6%, while the UK's FTSE 100 posted its biggest weekly loss this year of 5%. Investors are concerned about a slowdown in China and the knock-on effects for the global economy. Both France's Cac 40 and Germany's Dax indexes lost 7% of their value last week. In the Middle East, there is particular concern about low oil prices, which are down by more than a half this year and have been falling steadily since May, when Brent Crude stood at $68 a barrel. A barrel now costs $45. This is mainly due to an abundance of supply, in large part from from US shale oil producers, which are weakening OPEC's once dominant position in global oil markets. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are all members of OPEC. Moods were further dampened by a report from Fitch which cut the agency's outlook on Saudi Arabia from \"stable\" to \"negative\". The move reflects concerns about the future of the country's finances, which are heavily dependent on revenues from exporting oil. These worries come against a backdrop of falling global stock markets, reflecting widespread fears about the pace of the slowdown in the Chinese economy.

Hackers also made more use of unknown software bugs to make sure attacks work, said the annual threat report. It said the gangs behind the attacks had become more professional and now resembled legitimate software firms. \"They have extensive resources and highly skilled technical staff that operate with such efficiency that they maintain normal business hours and even take the weekends and holidays off,\" said Kevin Haley, director of Symantec security response in a statement. Call centres had been set up by some gangs to make scams and cons more effective, he said. Some of these groups were involved in tech support scams that try to trick people into paying to fix non-existent problems on their home computers. The US, UK, France, Australia and Germany were the hardest-hit by the fake support scams, it said. Fake pop-up warnings on websites were being used by some groups to try to convince people their computer was riddled with viruses. In a small number of cases, said Symantec, people who rang to get help had ransomware installed on their computer when they let fake support staff have remote access to their PC. Ransomware, which encrypts files on a computer that are only unlocked when victims pay a ransom, also remained popular among cybercriminals last year. The number of potential targets increased, it said, as ransomware for Apple Macs, smartphones and Linux all debuted in 2015. Last year was also remarkable for the huge number of data breaches companies and other organisations suffered, it said. More than 500 million records of login names, passwords and other ID information went astray in the last 12 months. In 2015, there were nine breaches that exposed more than 10 million records. By contrast, in 2014 only four breaches were this severe. One breach, of US Voter registration records, saw information about 191 million people exposed online. Hospitals, healthcare firms and insurance companies suffered the largest number of breaches, said the report. The ultimate number of digital identities that have been exposed could be higher, said Mr Haley, because many firms had stopped reporting exactly how much data had been lost. \"The increasing number of companies choosing to hold back critical details after a breach is a disturbing trend,\" he said. \"By hiding the full impact of an attack, it becomes more difficult to assess the risk and improve your security posture to prevent future attacks.\"", "question": "More than 500 million digital identities were stolen or exposed in 2015 , @placeholder a report from security firm Symantec .", "option_0": "blaming", "option_1": "including", "option_2": "suggests", "option_3": "continuing", "option_4": "suffering", "label": 2}

Whatever you make of the new American president, only Theresa May's most ardent critics would suggest that she shouldn't be meeting him. Why wouldn't you want the most powerful politician in the world as an ally? The relationship between the US and the UK though is always a special source of neuralgia for British leaders. David Cameron's team was almost embarrassingly pleased with the images of him and Barack Obama turning the sausages and burgers on the barbecue in the Number 10 garden. Look how cool David is!

A snub to meet among the ketchup bottles, to chat over the pastrami. And now? Theresa May is walking into a meeting with the most unorthodox president in decades, a man who today she will flatter, calling for the US and UK to \"lead together again\" as he starts to \"renew his nation\". A man who has found huge popularity among millions of voters precisely because he doesn't care for politician norms.

{"article": "One of the many surprises on 8 June was how Britain appeared to have turned the clock back to the era of two party politics, with 82% of voters casting their ballot for Labour or the Conservatives. Some of the surge in Labour's support may have been down to tactical voting, with left-leaning voters spooked by the prospect of a huge Conservative majority deciding to back whichever party they believed stood the best chance of beating the Conservatives in their constituency. Which, in most cases, was Labour. But in some parts of the country the choice was made easier for them. Local electoral deals saw some would-be election candidates stand aside to avoid splitting the \"anti-Tory\" vote. But despite warm words from some Labour and Lib Dem MPs, one party ended up doing most of the heavy lifting. Of the 41 seats listed by the Progressive Alliance, one of the organisations promoting tactical voting and cross-party cooperation, where \"progressive candidates have stood aside to help another progressive candidate defeat the Tories\", 38 of them were Greens, two were Lib Dems and one represented the Women's Equality Party. Not one Labour candidate stood aside, even though it was the Labour Party that got most of the benefit, in terms of extra votes and seats. The Green Party's co-leaders Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley got behind the idea of electoral alliances as a way of forcing proportional representation on to the political agenda, having spent years getting nowhere with efforts to get candidates that back electoral reform elected through first-past-the-post. Last year's Richmond Park by-election, which saw the Greens stand aside to help Lib Dem Sarah Olney defeat the then (and future) Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, had shown them what was possible and they had the backing of Green party members. But the Labour and Lib Dem leaderships refused to play ball, rejecting their offer of a formal deal at June's snap election out of hand. Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC: \"I just think the electorate would be concerned if they thought parties were stitching up elections privately. I don't think that's the way forward. The way forward is to support and vote for the Labour Party.\" Lib Dem leader Tim Farron was equally dismissive, despite support for the idea among some in his party, saying the \"only plausible route of any kind towards the Conservatives not winning a majority\" was having a sizable Liberal Democrat group of MPs. It was left to local Green parties to strike their own deals, if they could. It worked in some places, most notably Brighton Pavilion, where Caroline Lucas doubled her majority, after the Lib Dem candidate stood aside, as payback for Green support in Richmond Park. But her result was a rare bright spot in a dismal night for the Greens, who failed to gain any of their other target seats, and saw their vote drop from 1.1 million in 2015 to just over 500,000. It was a bad night for smaller parties in general. UKIP saw an even more dramatic collapse in its share of the vote than the Greens. The Lib Dems also saw their vote share squeezed - but only the Greens stood aside in significant numbers to aid other parties. On the day after the election, the Green Party's co-leader Jonathan Bartlett hailed the \"brave\" decision by 24 Green candidates in marginal seats to stand aside, which he said had made a \"big difference to the election result\". But that's not how some of the candidates-that-never-were felt. Green Party activist Jill Perry, who opted not to stand in Workington, said she now has \"regrets\" about doing so because she does not think it made any difference to the result, which saw the Labour candidate Sue Hayman retain the seat with a slightly reduced majority. It also deprived local Green members and supporters - including herself - of the opportunity to vote for their party, which on nuclear power, nuclear weapons and airport expansion, to name just a few issues, is diametrically opposed to the official Labour position. \"I voted with a heavy heart because, obviously, I could not vote Green,\" she says. \"It was a very difficult decision. It wasn't a personal decision, it was a group decision, but the group was very divided with strong feelings on both sides. \"Really, I don't think it made any difference where candidates stood down\" because a lot of people voted tactically to prevent the Conservatives getting a \"massive majority\" and, as a result, \"everybody went back into the Conservative and Labour silos\". The local Labour Party appreciated their gesture but Greens had been \"put under an awful lot of pressure\" by Labour activists in areas where they refused to stand aside, she added, and some Labour activists had been \"very aggressive towards them\". \"In solidarity with those groups, I think we should stand next time,\" said Ms Perry. Andy D'Agorne, leader of the Green group on York City Council, told the BBC he does not regret standing aside for Labour at the general election but he would not do it again, unless Labour was committed to proportional representation. The Greens have strong support in York, gaining 10% of the vote at the 2015 general election in York Central, but Mr D'Agorne said the unexpected surge in the Labour vote has made it a safe seat for Jeremy Corbyn's party, rendering any future gestures of solidarity unnecessary. Nicole Haydock, co-ordinator of Bury Green Party, which opted not to run candidates in June, said the \"backlash in the party after the election\" was because \"most people thought the progressive alliance meant we are standing down where Labour has a chance of winning\" when it was actually about getting an agreement to back proportional representation. Green activist John Coyne refused to stand aside in Wirral West, despite pressure from local Labour activists and members of Momentum, to help Labour's Margaret Greenwood hang on to the seat she had won from Tory Esther McVey by 417 votes in 2015. The 429 votes Mr Coyne received in June might have made all the difference in another close contest, but Ms Greenwood was returned as Wirral West's MP with a majority of 5,365. Mr Coyne said: \"If Labour said, 'yes we want PR' then that would make a big difference but all that's happened in discussions about alliances is that there has been an attempt to get people switching from Green to Labour, there has been no element of reciprocity at all, in this relationship. \"And for that reason, if no other, I think there is no real future for it.\" The BBC understands Liverpool Green Party plans to table a motion at the party's annual conference in October to rule out future alliances unless there is a PR deal on offer. There is also the practical concern that the electoral pacts have hit the Green Party in the wallet, as Short Money is handed out by Parliament in line with the number of votes parties get. In 2016/17 the Green Party of England and Wales got Â£216,994 in Short Money. It will be a lot less this year. Caroline Lucas said it was time for \"reflection and planning\" in the Green Party and has promised to listen to the membership about future electoral deals. She said it was \"clear\" that the local Green activists who stood aside in June \"helped cut down the Conservative majority\". But she added: \"The commitment to forming alliances was always about advancing significant electoral reform to give every voter a voice. \"We want to forge a new kind of politics, and simply tactical voting under first past the post does not even begin to rise to that challenge. \"Sadly there was no leadership from either Labour or the Liberal Democrats to put the urgent need for a fairer voting system at the heart of this election nationally.\" Frances Foley, campaign co-ordinator of Compass, the cross-party pressure group that set up the Progressive Alliance website and used tactics and personnel borrowed from Bernie Sanders in the US to promote it around the country, said she could understand how some Greens felt \"chastened\" by the drop in their party's vote share. But, she added, \"despite that there is still a really strong appetite for the progressive alliance in the Green Party\". There was also far more enthusiasm for cross-party cooperation, and proportional representation, among Labour activists than the party leadership, she claimed, and that change would eventually come \"from the ground up\". According to Compass's own research, \"progressive\" candidates performed 5.7% better where there was an electoral deal in place. She said the Labour leadership should view their success on 8 June as a \"shared victory,\" as a handful of Labour MPs, such as Clive Lewis, in Norwich South, and Tulip Siddiq, in Hampstead and Kilburn, had done - and it would be a mistake for them to believe they could win a general election on their own. To supporters like Ms Foley, the progressive alliance holds out the prospect of an end to petty tribal politics, as parties with similar world views - pro-European, anti-austerity, greenish - work together for what they see as the \"common good\". The combined forces of the SNP, Plaid Cymru, the Lib Dems, Labour and the Green Party, as well as smaller outfits like the Women's Equality Party and the NHS party, add up to a \"progressive\" majority, they argue. More than enough to beat what they call the \"regressive alliance\" of the Tories, UKIP and the Ulster Unionists. But to have any future it is going to take a major change in attitude at the top of the Labour Party to convince the Greens and other smaller parties it is worth the sacrifice.", "question": "Left - leaning parties worked together to cut Theresa May 's majority at the general election - was it a one - off or is the \" progressive alliance \" here to @placeholder ?", "option_0": "assess", "option_1": "prevent", "option_2": "die", "option_3": "stay", "option_4": "cope", "label": 3}

{"article": "The referendum was triggered by the Eurosceptic movement which used a new law designed to promote democracy to force a vote by gathering enough signatures on a petition. From the start, activists said this was a chance for voters in the country to express frustration at the EU, in particular what they see as its desire to expand despite democratic shortcomings. Although the turnout was only narrowly above the 30%  required to validate the result it has been hailed as a significant Eurosceptic victory. One \"No\" campaigner at a results party in Amsterdam described it as a \"slap in the face of the European monster\". In the UK Brexit activists were quick to claim the result showed anti-EU sentiment is growing despite the fact two-thirds of Dutch voters chose not to participate. While a vote in the Netherlands may not widely shape public opinion in the UK, it will embolden those campaigning for the UK to leave the EU. They will argue this result proves public concern over sovereignty and accountability is shared beyond Britain. But Netherlands voters were not asked to simply pass judgement on the EU, and throughout the campaign those promoting a \"Yes\" vote were frustrated by what they saw as attempts by Eurosceptics to hijack a debate which should have been about relations between Ukraine, Russia and Europe. Some say the multiple layers to this referendum means the result cannot be seen as a true reflection of the scale of euroscepticism in the Netherlands. Nonetheless the country is traditionally a stronghold of European integration, and the rejection of this deal will rattle the nerves of European leaders who are already struggling to maintain unity in the face of economic instability and the migrant crisis. The impact of this on the Ukraine agreement is not yet clear. Although the referendum was not binding, Prime Minister Mark Rutte signalled the result would not be ignored and he would now open discussions with EU leaders about how to proceed.

{"article": "At the same time, the first minister's tone was intriguing as she confirmed, in a news conference at Bute House, that the SNP will vote against a proposed incursion by the RAF into Syria when the Commons debates the issue tomorrow. I questioned Nicola Sturgeon as to whether there was ever any serious doubt that the SNP would be in the No lobby of the Commons when the vote was taken. In response, she went out of her way to emphasise that this was a carefully weighed decision, preceded by detailed thought and discussion. Her tone eschewed political rhetoric. Indeed, she praised the prime minister's efforts to attempt to convince sceptics, indicating that he had made progress in that direction. She summed up the position as \"an honest difference of opinion.\" So what is driving this approach? Firstly, this \"nuanced\" view - Nicola Sturgeon used that very adjective - is driven by conviction. Within the SNP leadership, Ms Sturgeon has taken particular pains to stress that it was important to think carefully, particularly in the aftermath of the Paris attacks. She deliberately left the impression that this was not primarily a decision from pre-existing first principles but rather a careful, pragmatic calculation based on an assessment of all the elements, in Syria and globally. So Ms Sturgeon accorded weight to the Prime Minister's persuasion but argued that it fell short on two points; the lack of a credible ground force to support air strikes and the lack of planning for post-conflict reconstruction in Syria. Without those, she argued, air strikes might well make matters worse. There are of course wider political calculations. There are some who have been adamant against air strikes from the outset. Ms Sturgeon is not in that camp, matching perhaps the troubled thoughts of many in Scotland and the wider UK as they reflect upon Paris.

{"article": "Morrissey has a funny place in British culture - he's an aloof national treasure whose melodramatic croon and pithy pop poetry are burned into the hearts of millions, yet whose hallowed status has been somewhat eroded in recent years thanks to his outspoken online rants. Despite all that, there are plenty of people who are wary of an attempt to tell his story in fictionalised form, who are fiercely protective of him and his band, and who see it as sacred ground. \"I just have to ignore them,\" says Mark Gill, who has directed and co-written England Is Mine, the movie about the singer's pre-fame years. Gill grew up less than a mile from Morrissey's house in Stretford, Manchester, and, like countless other 1980s music fans, was \"obsessed\" with The Smiths. So he was desperate to be the one to tell Morrissey's story. \"I wanted to make this film and I was determined that if anyone was going to cock it up, it would be me.\" England Is Mine follows Morrissey from moping mop-topped teenager to bequiffed budding idol. It ends when he meets future bandmate Johnny Marr. The consensus seems to be that Gill hasn't cocked it up, while the director says he thinks he has created \"something really special\". Gill became a fan of The Smiths after being given their first LP at the age of 15. But his dad wouldn't let his teenage son travel into Manchester to see them live before they split up in 1987. \"My dad loathes The Smiths,\" he says. \"He absolutely cannot stand them. He used to come in and say, 'Turn that off.'\" So what does Mr Gill senior make of the fact his son has directed his debut feature film about them? \"Who knows what he thinks. He probably thinks, when am I going to stop with this band?\" The release of England Is Mine comes three years after Gill and producing partner Baldwin Li were nominated for an Oscar for best live action short. Gill says he and England Is Mine co-writer William Thacker tried to strip away the persona that Morrissey has created since finding fame. \"We wanted to make him just a very human character,\" the director says. \"I kept saying we weren't making a film about Morrissey. \"It was about this young kid, and despite the fact he goes on to be somebody of great importance artistically, he did start out as a normal teenage kid going through the same sort of stuff that the rest of us have gone through. \"In a sense it relieved us all of that pressure of making a film about an icon, because we weren't. He goes on to do that. To me, the more interesting thing was the journey towards that. \"I grew up in Stretford in the '80s and it wasn't a ghetto by any stretch of the imagination, but if you were slightly different, the pack closes in on you. \"And Morrissey was very different, 10 years previously. So I often think, how did he survive?\" Steven Patrick Morrissey is played by Jack Lowden, who can also be seen currently in a very different role - that of a World War II Spitfire pilot in Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk. At 27, Lowden was born three years after The Smiths split up and was not a particular fan before he landed this role. \"Obviously I knew of him and I knew the reputation he had of being quite morose,\" Lowden says. \"And the script was so funny for me that I thought, we have to go for this.\" It was \"freeing\" to think only about those early years and not the singer's later image, the actor says. \"You cannot play a guy in the early part of his life if you're constantly aware of what he went on to become. And I think it did help that I was a Smiths virgin.\" Gill says he has not been in touch with the real Morrissey directly, but that the film-makers have \"done everything we can to be respectful\". He says: \"We don't want to upset him. And you'll see it's not that type of film.\" In recent years, Morrissey's most prominent forays into the public eye have been in the form of outspoken interviews and blogs. As well as his zealous protection of animal rights - his favourite subject - he also raised eyebrows with comments about politics, the royal family, the media and Islam. To some his candid views are refreshing. Others find him increasingly unsavoury. \"You can separate the person from the art I think,\" Gill says when asked what he thinks of Morrissey now. \"He says some things which you just laugh out loud at and there are other things I don't agree with, but that's the same with anybody. \"But one thing I do like about him is that he is one of the only artists who has consistently remained authentic. I don't see any difference between some of the things he says now and some of the things he said in The Smiths. \"His views may have hardened or softened in certain directions, but nowadays it's incredibly rare for somebody like that to speak his mind. Who else does that? Nobody.\" So what if Morrissey launches one of his famous tirades against this new film and its makers? \"I'll frame it,\" Gill replies with a smile. \"Nothing's going to change - the film's coming out. \"It would have been nice to have a conversation directly to say, 'This is what I'm doing.

{"article": "IS media channels say US-led airstrikes weakened the Tabqa dam, but US-backed fighters denied hitting the facility. Some reports say civilians have begun to flee, while others say they are being reassured they can stay. US-backed Syrian rebels are trying to capture Raqqa from IS. On Wednesday, the Pentagon said members of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance had been airlifted to positions behind IS lines close to the Tabqa dam, which is about 40km (25 miles) upstream of the city on the Euphrates river. However, the BBC is not able to independently confirm the condition of the IS-held dam - which provides power to the region - nor the orders received by Raqqa's civilians. Earlier the anti-IS activist group, Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, said people had started to flee the city - but that militants had been using loudspeakers to tell them that the dam was safe and that they should not leave. That comes despite IS channels saying the facility was at imminent risk of collapse amid rising water levels. A technical source at the dam told the AFP news agency there had been a power failure - but said damage to the dam would only pose a danger over time, with water levels not rising significantly so far. And another source told the BBC the power had been partially restored. Aside from being strategically important and providing electricity to the region, the dam is believed to be used by IS foreign fighters to plot attacks outside Syria, according to the Pentagon. The United Nations recently warned that damage to it could lead to massive-scale flooding. There were similar concerns last year for a dam outside Mosul, an IS stronghold in northern Iraq. If the Mosul dam burst, floodwaters could kill 1.47 million Iraqis living along the River Tigris, the US embassy said. However, the dam has so far remained in operation. US warplanes are supporting the Iraqi army's mission to retake Mosul from the Islamic State (IS). Meanwhile the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, supported by the US, are said to be closing in on Raqqa as well as the Tabqa dam.

{"article": "By embedding tiny tubes in the plants' leaves, they can be made to pick up chemicals called nitro-aromatics, which are found in landmines and other buried munitions. Real-time information can then be wirelessly relayed to a handheld device. The MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) work is published in the journal Nature Materials. The scientists implanted nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes (tiny cylinders of carbon) into the leaves of the spinach plant. They then delivered the nitro-aromatics into the water taken up by the roots and directly to the leaves in droplets. It takes about 10 minutes for the spinach to take up the water via the roots into the leaves. To read the signal, the researchers shine a laser onto the leaf, prompting the embedded nanotubes to emit near-infrared fluorescent light. This can be detected with a small infrared camera connected to a small, cheap Raspberry Pi computer. The signal can also be detected with a smartphone by removing the infrared filter most have. Co-author Prof Michael Strano, from MIT in Cambridge, US, said the work was an important proof of principle. \"Our paper outlines how one could engineer plants like this to detect virtually anything,\" he told the BBC News website. Prof Strano's lab has previously developed carbon nanotubes that can be used as sensors to detect hydrogen peroxide, TNT, and the nerve gas sarin. When the target molecule binds to a polymer material wrapped around the nanotube, it changes the way it glows. \"The plants could be use for defence applications, but also to monitor public spaces for terrorism related activities, since we show both water and airborne detection,\" said Prof Strano. \"Such plants could be used to monitor groundwater seepage from buried munitions or waste that contains nitro-aromatics.\" Using the set-up described in the paper, the researchers can pick up a signal from about 1m away from the plant, and they are now working on increasing that distance.

There are more than five million types of fungi, but only three major groups cause the majority of deaths in people: Prof Gow said: \"Most people know about mild fungal infections, but nobody's ever died from athlete's foot. \"However, a million people die a year from fungal infections and we need to understand these different types of infection and how to deal with them.\" The infections are more deadly in people with weakened immune systems - such as patients with HIV - so the fungal problem is particularly acute in Africa. \"It's an underappreciated problem and it's a very serious challenge in the parts of the world least equipped to deal with it,\" Prof Gow added. Patients having cancer therapy or who are taking immunosuppressant drugs after an organ transplant are also more susceptible to infection.

Davies launched Twickets in 2011, after he saw a fan offering to give away tickets to a show for free on Twitter instead of letting them go to waste. The London-based web designer believed many other people would rather sell tickets to music, sport or theatre events at cost price, or less, to real fans, rather than cash in and sell them at a profit through secondary ticket websites like Seatwave and Viagogo. His service began as a Twitter account, putting buyers and sellers in touch with one another. But it grew quickly, launching an app in 2013, and attracting the attention of artists like One Direction and Adele - both of whom have encouraged fans to use the service. The site is currently selling tickets to the V Festival, and Morrissey's Manchester show, both taking place this weekend, this year for less than face value. One Direction even sold 6,000 tickets for their On The Road Again tour directly through the site - although it is worth noting that Twicket's backers include artist management company Modest, whose clients include One Direction.

Initially, it will explore the feasibility of building a line linking the two cities. Hyperloop was originally  an idea from Tesla's boss and tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who conceived the technical details of the transport system but left it to commercial firms to make the vision a reality. The high-speed transportation system would use electric propulsion to accelerate a passenger or cargo pod through a low-pressure tube at speeds of up to 700mph. The vehicle would levitate above the track, which is likely to be built on stilts above the ground. There are currently two main firms attempting to make it a reality - Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) and Hyperloop One. Hyperloop One, which hosted its Dubai announcement at the top of the world's tallest building - the Burj Khalifa - has signed a feasibility deal with the emirate's roads and transportation agency. It will explore the possibility of using the technology at Dubai's Jebel Ali port. Journey times between Dubai and Abu Dhabi are currently an hour or more. It suggested that the system could also be used to cut journey times from Dubai to Riyadh to 48 minutes and from Dubai to Doha to 23 minutes. Rival Hyperloop firm HTT signed a deal in March to bring its technology to Slovakia, aiming to link Bratislava with Vienna and Budapest.

The ferry with 476 people on board sank off South Korea on 16 April. Divers have recovered 183 bodies, but scores are missing presumed drowned. Many of the victims were students and teachers from Danwon high school, south of Seoul. The ferry sank on a trip from the port of Incheon to the island of Jeju. In the latest move on Saturday, the arrests warrants were issued for two helmsmen and two members of the steering crew. Prosecutor Yang Jung-jin, of the joint investigation team, said the four crew members were taken into custody late on Friday, the Associated Press reported. The 15 crew members are facing charges of criminal negligence and of failing to help passengers, the prosecution says. On Friday, divers found 48 bodies of students wearing lifejackets in a single room on the vessel meant to accommodate just over 30 people. The group was crammed into a dormitory and all were wearing lifejackets, a South Korean Navy officer said. The presence of so many victims in the cabin suggested many had run into the room when the ship tilted, correspondents said. The head of the operation to retrieve bodies said he had \"no idea\" how long the ship search would take. Furious relatives have repeatedly criticised the speed of the recovery operation. On a visit to Seoul on Friday, US President Barack Obama expressed his condolences for South Korea's \"incredible loss\" and offered America's solidarity. \"So many were young students with their entire lives ahead of them,\" Mr Obama said. \"I can only imagine what the parents are going through at the moment - the incredible heartache.\" The South Korean government has said it is \"mobilising all available resources\" towards the rescue effort. The prosecutors are also said to be investigating whether modifications made to the ferry made it more unstable. Factors under consideration include a turn made around the time the ship began to list, as well as wind, ocean currents and the freight it was carrying. Reports have emerged indicating that the ship's sleeping cabins were refitted some time between 2012 and 2013, which experts say may have inadvertently affected the balance of the boat.", "question": "All 15 crew members involved in the @placeholder of the ill - fated South Korean passenger ferry Sewol are now reportedly in custody , facing criminal negligence charges .", "option_0": "navigation", "option_1": "version", "option_2": "construction", "option_3": "loss", "option_4": "absence", "label": 0}

When police initially called at his room, his wife told police, he had left Rio de Janeiro at the weekend and returned to Ireland. Undeterred, police began a search of the hotel and found Mr Hickey in another room that they said was under his son's name. He was escorted off the premises wearing his dressing gown to face questions about his alleged role in a scheme to sell Olympic tickets for higher than their face value - an allegation he denies. Quite a fall for a man at the top of his career. Born in Dublin in 1945, Patrick Joseph Hickey represented his country internationally in judo - a minor sport in Ireland in the 1970s. In 1979, he was appointed president of the Irish Judo Association. Five years later, he managed the Irish Olympic team at the Los Angeles Olympics. From the country's chef de mission at the 1998 Seoul and 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games, he succeeded Des O'Sullivan as president of the Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI) in 1988. He was subsequently elected as Irish member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1995. However, he became \"a prime mover\", in the OCI's words, in July 2006, when he was elected president of the European Olympic Committees. He was re-elected in 2009. From there, he progressed on to the 15-strong International Olympic Committee in 2012. Previously described by the OCI as \"probably the top-ranked Irish administrator in the world of international sport\", the organisation said on Wednesday that Mr Hickey had stood down temporarily from his roles after being arrested during the Rio Olympics amid illegal ticket sales claims.

A Beijing judge had suggested that her face be examined by medical professionals to certify its authenticity.

She was accompanied by notaries public and several journalists. Hospital chief Qi Zuoliang later pronounced her looks to be genuine. \"Baby's entire head and facial bones do not have any signs of incisions,\" he told reporters, using a popular abbreviation of the actress' stage name. News of her examination dominated discussion on Chinese social network Sina Weibo on Thursday, with many of her fans expressing support. Angelababy, who first shot to fame as a model and actress in Hong Kong, has long been dogged by rumours that she had plastic surgery, with pictures purportedly showing her natural face circulating online in recent years. She is suing Beijing beauty clinic Ruili for carrying an article on its website in 2012 alleging that she had plastic surgery, and is seeking 500,000 yuan (Â£51,000; $79,000) in compensation.

Angelababy married Huang last Thursday in one of the biggest and most lavish celebrity weddings China had seen, which reportedly cost 200 million yuan (Â£20.3m; $31.5m). Huang has previously defended the actress, saying in a 2014 interview: \"Actually she sometimes looks quite ugly to me.\" \"I'm not an idiot, I definitely can tell she hasn't had plastic surgery, sometimes she doesn't put on make up and she really looks like those ugly pictures of her.\"", "question": "A top Chinese actress has had her face examined as part of a high - profile @placeholder case in China , local media report .", "option_0": "lost", "option_1": "imposed", "option_2": "legal", "option_3": "illegal", "option_4": "national", "label": 2}

A more sombre Mrs Clinton took full responsibility in Friday's interview, saying she didn't \"stop and think\" about how use of a private email account would be perceived.

Rope died aged 71 in relative obscurity. For more stories on Victorian England visit our Pinterest board Rope's colourful windows survive today in churches across the UK, Australia, South Africa and Rome - and in museums in Los Angeles and New York. Marga, as she was known to her friends, wore her hair short, smoked cheroot cigars and forged a career at a time when women were largely suppressed, Dr Sally Hoban, a historian at Birmingham University, said. \"There's a story about her and her sister riding across England on their motorbikes at the beginning of the First World War,\" her cousin Arthur Rope said. \"When they got to Suffolk they got arrested for being German spies because people couldn't imagine what two women were doing on motorbikes.\" Aged 18, Rope enrolled at the Birmingham School of Arts where she learned to design and make stained glass. Less than 10 years later, when she began to gain recognition for her art, Rope became a devout Catholic and chose the harsh life of poverty and prayer as a Carmelite nun, Mr Rope said. Rope joined the Carmelite Monastery in Quidenham, Norfolk, where, shut off from the world, she continued to create stained glass in a small studio.

{"article": "The BBC has heard from Britons who have already started taking steps towards obtaining dual nationality in another EU country. Some are hoping it will help them continue to live and work in the 27 other countries that make up the union while others have more ideological reasons. Name: Rachel Pilling From: London Applying for passport in: Germany Rachel has started the process of applying for German citizenship - an option that is open to her because her Jewish grandmother fled Nazi Germany in 1936 and ultimately settled in London. The naturalisation claim under article 116 of the German Basic Law allows anybody who was deprived of their German citizenship between 30 January 1933 and 8 May 1945 on political, racial or religious grounds to reclaim their citizenship.  Importantly, this also applies to any of their direct descendants. \"I previously felt there would be no benefit in having a German passport as well as a British passport but if we leave the EU, then that may well change,\" says Rachel. \"There is a real sense of sadness about this throughout my family. I have spoken to my grandmother and, while she will not be applying, she supports the idea of the rest of us doing so. Despite everything that happened in the past, she is really in favour of Europe and feels a lot of love for Europe. \"At the moment I am free to study or work anywhere in the EU. I can't be certain that it will stay that way. If there were no physical advantages with regards to studying and working abroad then I probably wouldn't apply for a German passport but this could have a big influence on my life,\" she adds. Name: Joanne Munro From: Brighton Applying for passport in: Italy or Croatia Joanne doesn't actually think having an EU passport will make much practical difference, \"except for shorter queues in the airport\", and her reasons for applying are \"symbolic\". \"I am an EU citizen and I'm not prepared to have anybody take that away from me,\" she says. \"I feel European and looking at the bigger picture in the long term, we need to be able to act as one people, on one planet. There needs to be more unity, not more division so holding onto my European citizenship and passport is a way to stay loyal to that idea.\" The 44-year-old hopes her grandmother, born in a village near Trieste in modern-day Italy, may provide her route to obtaining a European passport. Initially confident that she would be eligible for an Italian passport under the legal principle of Jure Sanguinis (right of blood), a territorial dispute over which country Trieste belonged to back in 1922 has made her quest more challenging. She may have to apply for Croation citizenship instead. \"It's an omni-shambles really but I have all of the paperwork and one way or another I am going to get a European passport,\" she says. Name: Oliver Baroni From: London Applying for passport in: Italy Oliver lives in Zurich and has both British and Swiss passports. As Switzerland is outside the European Union, the 44-year-old now faces the prospect of holding two non-EU passports. Since the result of the EU referendum, he has begun researching his Italian roots and says he is doing so for the benefit of his sons, aged eight and 18. \"It just makes me mad that my kids won't be able to travel freely in Europe to study or work,\" he says. The musician also hopes that having another passport might help make it easier for his band, The HillBilly Moon Explosion, when they tour in Europe. \"The first thing I did when it became clear that there had been a vote to leave the EU was to Google 'apply for Italian citizenship' and apparently it is not too difficult. The paperwork is likely to be a pain in the neck but it should be possible.\" Any claim made will be based on the fact Oliver's mother was born in Italy before moving to Switzerland and then the UK. Name: Damian Allinson From: Bristol Applying for passport in: Ireland Damian, who works in finance in London, is determined not to let Brexit undermine his links to Europe. The 25-year-old campaigned to remain in the EU and is chair of the London branch of the Young European Movement a group encouraging, dialogue, debate and involvement in European relations for young people. \"Like most 'Remainers', I have not only the disappointment of losing the vote but also the knowledge that I've had a lot of my hopes and career ambitions scuppered by Brexit unless I can get EU citizenship,\" he says. Damian is entitled to an Irish passport as his maternal grandfather was from County Mayo. He began work on his application before the referendum was announced because he thought it would help his plans to work in the US. \"I would have liked to have had the passport anyway but now I need it to retain my ties to the continent in terms of travel, work and culture.\" Name: Hannah Neira From: Horsham Applying for passport in: Spain Hannah's father's side of the family is Spanish and she is very close to her paternal grandparents.

Sleeping in strange places is something of a national sport in China, as demonstrated by this lorry driver, pictured next to a busy road in the city of Ningbo in 40C (104F) heat. Bernd Hagemann, who took these pictures and is the author of Sleeping Chinese, puts the nation's habit of sleeping in unconventional places down to long working hours and cramped living conditions. But he also thinks it is socially more acceptable to sleep in public in China than some other countries. \"Sleeping has - according to Chinese people - a very high rank in the list of values,\" he adds. Dozing in odd places is not unique to China of course, as demonstrated by this labourer in Jakarta, Indonesia, pictured lying on a pile of rice sacks. Michael Oko, a specialist in sleep apnoea at the Sleeping Disorders Centre, says there is no cheating the \"sleep deficit\". \"Power naps help,\" he says \"but they are just a temporary fix. You need sleep hygiene with a regular routine and to get between six to eight hours sleep a day. Below that, you are not going to be well.\" In the case of the Alaska Airlines baggage handler, Mr Oko says an investigation would most likely look at his recent shift patterns and whether he has any underlying sleep problems such as snoring or breath-holding. He says men, people over 50 and those with a body mass index of more than 35 are most likely to have sleep disorders. \"Micro sleeps\" when someone sleeps for moments while doing something like driving, are the most dangerous types of naps, says Mr Oko.

The hall in Nauen, just west of Berlin, was burnt down in August 2015 as large numbers of asylum seekers arrived in Germany. No one was injured in the blaze but the hall was completely destroyed, with the cost of the damage estimated at â‚¬3.5m (Â£3m). An accomplice, who was not identified by the DPA news agency, was given a seven-year term, while four others were given suspended sentences of varying lengths. During the trial, 29-year-old Schneider had claimed that he was trying to send a political message but had not meant to burn down the building. He also denied that he had acted out of xenophobic motives. Many Germans consider the NPD, which has 5,000 members, to be a neo-Nazi group. Judge Theodor Horstkotter said Schneider and his accomplices had clearly acted on right-wing extremist beliefs. \"The attack was meant to signal to refugees: you are not welcome here, we don't have space for you, you aren't safe here,\" he said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's office describes the NPD as an \"anti-democratic, xenophobic, anti-Semitic, anti-constitutional party\". The six men prosecuted are reported to have previously committed other crimes, including setting fire to the car of a Polish citizen.

The judge granted Mr Greene's motion to compel a deposition in New York on Thursday, Hollywood Reporter said. The Wolf of Wall Street, directed by Martin Scorsese, saw DiCaprio play real-life swindling stockbroker Belfort and was based on his memoirs. Mr Greene is suing producers including Paramount Pictures, Red Granite Pictures, DiCaprio's Appian Way Productions and Sikelia Productions. The character of Nicky \"Rugrat\" Koskoff  wore a toupee and was the subject of the movie line \"swear to God, I want to choke him to death\". He was played by PJ Byrne. Mr Green said the film changed his nickname from \"Wigwam\" to \"Rugrat,\" adding it spread untruths about him and that damages to his reputation were worth $15m (£10.5m). The claims were rejected, but a judge allowed the claimant to assert instead that the filmmakers maliciously libelled him. Thursday's hearing, chaired by magistrate judge Steven Locke, overruled arguments that DiCaprio's testimony only serves as harassment and coercion. The defendants had argued Scorsese and screenwriter Terence Winter had already testified, and that the claimants had not stated why they needed DiCaprio to testify as he did not write the screenplay or play the character. Mr Greene has said he worked at Stratton Oakmont between 1993 and 1996 as the head of the firm's corporate finance department and a member of the board of directors.

{"article": "At a news conference with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr Trump promised to deliver a \"great\" peace deal, but said both sides must compromise. The Israelis and Palestinians have had no substantive peace talks since 2014. In the conference, Mr Trump also asked his visitor to \"hold off\" on settlement building for \"a little bit\". Israel has approved thousands of new homes in West Bank and East Jerusalem settlements since Mr Trump took office last month. The Israeli government is hoping for better relations with the White House after eight years of friction with the former Obama administration. At Wednesday's press conference, neither leader committed explicitly to back a future independent Palestine, a longstanding bedrock of US policy. A \"two-state solution\" to the decades-old conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is the declared goal of their leaders and the international community. It is the shorthand for a final settlement that would see the creation of an independent state of Palestine within pre-1967 ceasefire lines in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, living peacefully alongside Israel. The UN, the Arab League, the European Union, Russia and, until now, the US routinely restate their commitment to the concept. Reconsidering the two-state solution \"So I'm looking at two states and one state,\" said Mr Trump. \"And I like the one that both parties like. I'm very happy with the one that both parties like. \"I can live with either one. I thought for a while that two states looked like it may be the easier of the two. \"To be honest, if Bibi [Mr Netanyahu] and the Palestinians, if Israel and the Palestinians are happy - I'm happy with the one they like the best.\" He said it would ultimately be up to the parties themselves to reach a peace agreement. Mr Trump was also asked about his election promise to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which could have serious implications for any peace negotiations. \"As far as the embassy moving to Jerusalem, I'd love to see that happen,\" Mr Trump said. \"And we're looking at it very, very strongly. We're looking at it with a great care, a great care, believe me. And we'll see what happens.\" When he was asked about a two-state solution, Mr Netanyahu said he wanted to focus on \"substance\" and not \"labels\". \"There are two prerequisites for peace,\" said the Israeli prime minister. \"First the Palestinians must recognise the Jewish state. \"Second, in any peace agreement, Israel must retain the overriding security control over the entire area west of the Jordan River.\" Meanwhile the Palestinian presidency stressed its commitment to a two-state solution and an end to the Israeli occupation, Reuters news agency reported. Earlier officials had urged the White House not to abandon the concept of a Palestinian state. The presidency said it was ready to \"deal positively\" with the Trump administration, and agreed with Mr Trump's call for Israel to hold off on settlement building. It was the US and Israeli leaders' first face-to-face meeting since Mr Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election. A retreat from US backing for a two-state solution would upend decades of American - and international - policy embraced by Republican and Democratic administrations. On Tuesday, a senior White House official signalled a potential policy shift by saying peace did not necessarily have to entail Palestinian statehood, and that Mr Trump would not try to \"dictate\" a solution. More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land Palestinians claim for a future state. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. A relatively large group of journalists followed Mr Netanyahu from Israel to cover his first meeting with President Trump. A lot was at stake, especially after the eight years of the strained relations with the Obama administration. Ahead of the meeting, the general sentiment among them concerned the lack of clarity on how the meeting between the two leaders would go. Whether they will get along and mostly what will be said on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the two-state solution, a formula which has been a long-term tenet of US and Israeli policy. Waiting in the East Room for the press conference, journalists were filing reports, posting on social media and also getting their selfies taken with White House insignias. So did Israeli officials. The two leaders entered the room, and as very warm words were exchanged, it looked like the turning of a page in the relationship between the two countries. But perhaps it was also another turning point, departing from the two-state solution formula, a term they avoided using. Their  confidence gave the impression that some sort of regional deal is perhaps already being explored with moderate Arab countries.

Mr Cunha was for many years one of Brazil's most powerful politicians. He led the impeachment process against President Dilma Rousseff, who was dismissed in August. Mr Cunha, from the centre-right PMDB party, was expelled from the Brazilian Congress last month. He was arrested in the capital, Brasilia, and has been transferred to the southern city of Curitiba, where federal judge Sergio Moro is leading the corruption probe. Mr Moro said he had ordered the arrest because there was \"a real possibility of [Mr Cunha] fleeing the country as he has resources hidden abroad\". The fact that he has dual Brazilian and Italian citizenship also increased the risk of him trying to evade justice, added Mr Moro. Mr Cunha has been detained for an indeterminate period. Petrobras is at the centre of a massive kickbacks scandal which cost the company $2bn (Â£1.5bn) and has led to the arrest of dozens of lawmakers and top businessmen. At least three businessmen have said under interrogation that they paid bribes to Mr Cunha, which they deposited in his overseas accounts.

But Health Minister Simon Hamilton said transplant surgeons had written to him urging caution about any law change. The proposed legislation would mean consent to take organs would be presumed unless someone had taken action to remove themselves from the register. Additional safeguards would also mean that a \"qualifying person\", a friend or relative, for example, would have to affirm that the deceased person would not have objected. The bill will now be referred to the assembly's health committee, and will face several more stages before it could become law. Surgeons said that in countries where opt-out was enforced, higher organ donation rates were down to public awareness rather than legislation. In their letter, Belfast Health Trust surgeons said that per head of population the number of living kidney donors in Northern Ireland was more than twice the UK average. They said that was down to the generosity of people in Northern Ireland and the public attitude towards transplantation. \"While fully supportive of the principle of increasing the number of deceased donor organs available to provide life-saving transplantation, we are cautious about any change which, although well-meaning, may potentially have a detrimental impact on the public's willingness to donate,\" they wrote.

{"article": "Her case was dismissed on the basis that it was brought well outside a 14-day time limit for seeking to judicially review her exclusion. The inquiry was announced by the Northern Ireland Executive in 2010. It followed a damning report in the Republic of Ireland into decades of abuse in some religious institutions. With the inquiry set to get under way early next year, a judge said it was never intended to widen the tribunal's scope. Any extension of its remit would mean it could not complete its work on time or in budget, Belfast High Court was told. Mr Justice Treacy's verdict appears to have closed the door to others who claim they were abused while being fostered. Headed by the retired judge Sir Anthony Hart, it will examine claims of abuse in children's homes, care institutions and borstals between 1922 and 1995. The woman at the centre of the legal challenge cannot be identified. She claims she was abused after being taken into care and put into a foster home by social services in the early 1990s. Although she wanted to participate in the inquiry, she was informed earlier this year that her case did not fall within its terms of reference. Seeking to judicially review that decision, her legal team contended it was the state who placed her into foster care. According to them the inquiry is looking into any alleged failings by institutions or the state. Counsel for the inquiry argued, however, that foster care cases were never intended to be part of its remit. The court was also told of a stipulation that any judicial review proceedings must be brought within 14 days of being informed of the inquiry's decision. It made little difference whether that was in April or June this year in the woman's case, according to Mr Justice Treacy. \"The proceedings were issued in either event well outside the time limit,\" he said. \"No sufficient reason has been advanced to explain the delay, and no sufficient reason was given to persuade me that it would be appropriate to extend time.\" Dismissing the application for leave to seek a judicial review, the judge added that neither the Stormont Executive or Assembly intended the inquiry's remit to include investigating alleged foster care abuse.", "question": "A woman allegedly abused in foster care has failed in a legal challenge to being kept out of an inquiry into @placeholder abuse at children 's homes .", "option_0": "historic", "option_1": "illegal", "option_2": "amateur", "option_3": "racial", "option_4": "alleged", "label": 0}

{"article": "That scenario is, at best, decades away. But this week I’ve been pondering something much more immediate, and in my view, more likely. What will happen when humans decide to become robots? \"We’re at a key transition in human history,” says Prof Hugh Herr, who heads the Biomechatronics Group at the famed Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He says the group’s aim is to establish the scientific and technological conditions that will eventually eliminate disability, whether through paralysis or amputation. But when that incredible goal has been achieved, then what? \"We’re fusing the nervous system with the built world,” he says. \"We’re transitioning from a relationship where we use technology that is separate from our nervous system, to a new epoch of integration, of human physiology.\" Simulating ankles Prof Herr is a double amputee. In 2012, I saw him move a room in London to tears when he revealed his incredibly sophisticated bionic legs that allowed him to move with natural poise and grace. In 2014, Prof Herr’s technology meant Adrianne Haslet-Davis returned to the dancefloor, less than a year after  losing a limb in the Boston marathon bombings. Her first performance after the incident brought a TED talk audience instantly to its feet. I visited Prof Herr’s lab last week to learn more about the work his team is doing, and where it may lead. Right now, much of the research is focused on doing things the human body can do instinctively, but which are extremely complex to engineer. Roman Stolyarov, a researcher at the lab, demonstrated how they are using sensors similar to those found on self-driving cars to give prosthetic legs an awareness of what is around them. This is important to make the leg behave differently when, for example, walking down stairs. The human brain, whether the person realises it or not, is able to instinctively prepare the leg to land on a step. Teaching a prosthesis to do the same is the difference between having a bionic leg and, to put it crassly, a peg leg. “The motor is able to work in such a way that simulates a real biological ankle joint,” Mr Stolyarov told me. “The [leg] uses on-board sensors to infer whether the leg is in the air or on the ground, and perform actions that to the person feel much more like real walking than they would get from a passive prosthesis.” The end result is that walking is considerably less tiring for amputees like Ryan Cannon, who lost his leg following complications after he broke it. “I can move in a more rhythmic, symmetrical way,” he told me. \"Being able to move in that manner allows me to walk at a faster pace for a longer distance and to do more activities during the day.” But not all the work carried out here is about replacing limbs. It’s also looking at improving them. One exoskeleton project reduces the physical exertion when walking by 25%, explained researcher Tyler Clites. “What that means is, if you were to walk 100 miles, it would only feel like you walked 75. \"We’re able to do that today. Those are devices I would expect to see rolling out commercially in the next several years.” Beyond MIT, others are working on similar initiatives. US retail chain Lowes is piloting exoskeltons for staff, developed at Virginia Tech, that assist them with lifting at work. “I definitely think that we are entering an age in which the line between biological systems and synthetic systems is going to be very much blurred,” Mr Clites said. He said this future brings a concern that the rich and fortunate of the world may become physically superior, too. “Then what you do is create a new baseline for physical ability, and perhaps mental ability, that’s only achievable by people who are already in a position of privilege.” That said, Prof Herr said he was confident that as the cost of prosthetics became lower, it wouldn’t leave poorer people behind. \"The cost of robotics is going to plummet,” he said. \"It’s hard to predict whether there’ll be large separations in society.\" Amputation reinvention Before that day, work will be mostly focused on improving the lives of amputees. But in that endeavour, one of the obstacles hindering Prof Herr’s work is one of compatibility. Much like an old computer peripheral that can't plug into a new laptop, nor can most amputees “plug in” to the latest technologies being developed in this lab. To solve this, the team is urgently trying to change the way limbs are amputated. \"The method that is used today to amputate limbs has fundamentally not changed since the US Civil War,” Prof Herr said. \"So while you’ve seen tremendous progress in mechatronics and robotics, you’ve not seen progress in how surgeries are performed to amputate limbs. That is now changing. \"We’re redesigning how limbs are amputated to create the right mechanical and electrical interfacing environment.” He said this interfacing would join the brain directly to the limb, creating a sense among amputees that they are making their bodies whole again. \"What we’re experiencing clinically is that when we attach these limbs to people and we listen to their testimonials, they use language such as 'I have my limb back, I’m healed, it’s part of me’.” Once that breakthrough is fully achieved - and there’s evidence of progress literally walking around Prof Herr’s lab - he said humans will surely begin to consider themselves eligible for an upgrade. \"We’ll be more open to using all kinds of materials to make up our bodies,” he said. ___________ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370", "question": "We all like to joke about what might happen if robots , powered by artificial intelligence , decide they want to @placeholder humans .", "option_0": "lose", "option_1": "offer", "option_2": "achieve", "option_3": "deter", "option_4": "overthrow", "label": 4}

Scar tissue and the remains of the tumour have left her with epilepsy and daily seizures. Miss Hall is due to undergo specialist surgery using the ROSA robotic surgery assistant in Sheffield in March. The city's Royal Hallamshire Hospital says it is the only NHS hospital in the UK with ROSA. Charity Neurocare has launched a Â£250,000 appeal to secure its future. Miss Hall had two surgeries to remove her tumour in 1993 and had further surgery in 2004.

He was punished for the incidents and disobedience in July 2006. Tests showed his body temperature was 41.7C, the normal temperature is 37C. Tests also showed he had ecstasy in his body when he died. Three non-commissioned officers who carried out the punishment - Sgt Russell Price, 45, Sgt Paul Blake, 37, and Cpl John Edwards, 42, were found not guilty of manslaughter by a jury at Winchester Crown Court in 2008. An inquest into Pte Williams's death, being held at Wiltshire and Swindon Coroner's Court in Salisbury, heard he had been out drinking on the weekend before his death and is thought to have taken ecstasy in a nightclub, although none of his friends saw him take drugs. When he returned to his barracks there was an incident with a fire extinguisher in which guests of an officer were sprayed with water, the inquest heard.

{"article": "At a winding-up hearing at the High Court, Orient owner Francesco Becchetti has been given until 12 June to pay off debts or sell the club. The League Two side were the subject of a winding-up petition brought by HM Revenue & Customs over unpaid taxes. Those debts have now been paid, but money is owed to four other creditors. Chief executive Alessandro Angelieri gave the court a statement saying Becchetti would invest £1m to pay off remaining debts in eight to 10 weeks. Adam Michaelson, legal adviser to the Leyton Orient Fans' Trust, told BBC Radio London: \"It leaves the club in a state of significant uncertainty and frankly mortal danger. \"In respect of a potential sale, we would call upon Mr Becchetti now to look to sell the club at the earliest possible opportunity and make good on the promise that he's made.\" In January, Becchetti said he would be willing to consider selling the struggling League Two side, which he bought in 2014. The club's latest set of accounts, from the year ending 30 June 2015, showed the club had debts of £5,512,449 - more than the value of the club's assets of £5.5m. Analysis - Phil Parry, BBC Radio London So, with a sword of Damocles still swinging over their heads, Orient will have to battle on. Mathematically they still have a chance to avoid relegation, although form would suggest that is unlikely. They have eight games left, are seven points from safety and have picked up just three points from the last 24 available. Off the pitch, with outstanding bills yet to be paid, operations at Brisbane Road may be difficult. For example, a company which provides matchday stewards is on the list of creditors, and perhaps the remaining matchday programmes may not return to full size. As we wait to see if the extra £1m investment promised in court materialises, fans will continue to make preparations for all eventualities.

Disturbingly the symptoms took 24 hours to clear. The question that popped into my head was: what if someone does this every day? Do they live a life in a permanently sub concussive state? How does this affect them in older life? What about youngsters whose brains are more prone to damage? Oh we know about concussions, but we thought the days of heading an old, sodden, leather football were gone. We know about elbows and head knocks, and we know about footballers and rugby players with early onset dementia. But we didn't know that just heading a ball caused so much damage to the brain.

I played rugby, I have a son who plays rugby, and a daughter who plays international football. I hope beyond hope that this test doesn't mean I have been a fool to encourage both of them into sport. But this, of all the research I have seen, is the piece of work that alarms me the most. More and more research is pointing to the fact that the bit of my body I was least worried about hurting by taking up sport - my brain - might just have been the most vulnerable after all.

Commenting on the case, Leicester City Council said religion was \"not a sensible excuse\" and drivers are told about the law on their licence and during exams. \"It's extremely frustrating,\" said Mr Bloch, a student at De Montfort University in Leicester. \"But, it's a very common thing and happens a lot.\" Mr Bloch has deteriorating eyesight due to glaucoma and in April was refused a ride by an Uber driver who also cited religious reasons. \"I have no hatred towards the driver and his religion, and I would respect that if the law wasn't there, but the law is there to help people be more integrated into the community,\" he said. Under the Disability Discrimination Act, it is illegal for a private hire vehicle to refuse to take a disabled person because they have an assistance dog, nor can they charge more. Anyone found guilty of an offence under the act is liable to a fine. Assistance dogs are defined as dogs trained to guide someone who is blind, deaf, epileptic or suffers a condition which affects mobility. Drivers can apply to a licensing authority for exemption from carrying assistance dogs, but only on medical grounds. Source: UK Government ADT Taxis posted a statement on its Facebook page, saying it was \"deeply ashamed\" by the driver's conduct. A city council spokesman said: \"Drivers are legally required to accept bookings from passengers with assistance dogs unless the driver has a medical exemption certificate. \"We're not aware of any taxi drivers in Leicester to which this applies.\" He said they were considering whether to revoke the driver's licence and had contacted Mr Bloch with regards to legal action being taken.", "question": "A blind man was barred from using a taxi by a driver who took religious @placeholder to his guide dog .", "option_0": "lost", "option_1": "belonging", "option_2": "exception", "option_3": "orders", "option_4": "references", "label": 2}

{"article": "The study suggested only 12% feel their work-life balance is \"just right\". Less than a quarter (22%) think they have \"the right balance of time and money for their family to thrive\". The poll was carried out by Family Friendly Working Scotland group, which works with the Scottish government. The organisation said inflexible work arrangements were often to blame, with many parents saying they missed out on special family moments. These included attending school plays or putting their children to bed. The poll suggested: Family Friendly Working Scotland said its findings showed 27% of working parents in Scotland worked more than two extra unpaid hours each week - the equivalent of an extra 2.5 weeks a year. Of those, 15% worked more than four extra unpaid hours a week, equating to 25 extra days a year. The findings were published as Family Friendly Working Scotland launched Nation Work Life week. Nikki Slowey, the organisation's programme director, said it was \"disheartening that so few Scottish parents have the right work-life balance\". She said: \"Families need both time and money to thrive, yet less than a quarter of parents we surveyed said they have this. \"As parents we want to support our children through the many milestones in their lives, whether that's starting school, starring in their school play or preparing for important exams. \"But balancing this support alongside the demands of work can be very challenging, especially if your employer gives you little or no flexibility, or shows no understanding.\" Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Ms Slowey added: \"I don't think there are enough employers recognising the link between good family-friendly policies or good flexible working and how this is good for business. \"Not enough organisations are making the link that actually when they have a family-friendly workplace their employees are more productive, more engaged, more motivated and that the absenteeism rates reduce, and that they are much more successful at recruiting and retaining staff.\" The Scottish government's Minister for Childcare and Early Years, Mark McDonald, said: \"This poll shows how difficult it can be for parents in Scotland to achieve the right balance between the time they spend at work and with their family. \"The Scottish government is determined to do all we can to ensure Scotland's workplaces offer flexible working arrangements so parents can achieve a balance that suits their family life, and employers can benefit from improved rates of loyalty and productivity.\"", "question": "Most working parents in Scotland are unhappy with the balance between their home and work life , according to a poll by a group of @placeholder organisations .", "option_0": "voluntary", "option_1": "extreme", "option_2": "crude", "option_3": "political", "option_4": "professional", "label": 0}

Liz Saville Roberts has become Plaid Cymru's first female MP to take over from Elfyn Llwyd at Dwyfor Meirionnydd. Prime Minister David Cameron paid tribute to the party's outgoing parliamentary leader in March. The Conservatives have won the constituency of Gower - a seat Labour has held for more than 100 years.

Labiofam said Ernesto, the cologne named after the Argentine-born revolutionary who helped Fidel Castro take over in Cuba in 1959, would be a woodsy and refreshing citric scent with notes of talcum powder. Hugo, named after the late Venezuelan president, would offer a softer, fruitier fragrance with hints of mango and papaya. \"They will be very attractive colognes, but the names also mean a lot to us,\" said Isabel Gonzalez, vice-president for research and development for Labiofam during the launch.

Chadian opposition parties say she should have been banned from visiting describing her as a champion of \"fascist\" policies. It is the first time Ms Le Pen is in Africa in an official capacity. The plane carrying Ms Le Pen to Chad departed only a few hours after she took part in a live presidential debate on French TV where she reasserted that fighting Islamist fundamentalist networks would be her priority as president. The Barkhane force is made up of about 3,000 French soldiers along with troops from Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Chad. It has been set up in an effort to stifle jihadist groups in the Sahel region in West and North Africa. Ms Le Pen's planned meeting with the French soldiers is seen as a move to mark her commitment to stopping Islamist fundamentalism at the root before it is exported to France. France has been hit in recent years by deadly attacks, including the Charlie Hebdo killings and the Bataclan night club attack, all claimed by radical Islamist groups.

{"article": "Here, Anjali and her uncle - her father has migrated to Pune to look for work, and her mother is a vegetable vendor - will stand under the blazing sun for up to three hours to fill 150 litres of drinking water in 15 containers, a smorgasbord of shiny kitchen utensils and brightly coloured plastic tanks. At home, the taps dried up three months ago. Every eighth day a municipal water tanker comes to her street, providing 200 litres of water to every family. It's never enough for her family, so Anjali, frail and enervated, is spending her summer holidays collecting water in the soaring heat. Aren't you afraid that she might suffer from a heatstroke? I ask her uncle. Last week a 12-year-old girl died of heatstroke after spending four hours gathering water from a hand pump in the neighbouring Beed district. Anjali had already spent more than two hours when I met her. The uncle shrugs off my question. \"Compulsion, compulsion,\" he mutters under his breath. \"We don't have a choice.\" The scarcity of water leaves people with few - and mostly awkward - choices. So it is with Latur's residents, who are among the 330 million people in 256 districts in India affected by drought, brought on by three years of poor rainfall. Not surprisingly, the lives of half a million people in the district's main city now revolve around water. They worry about getting supplies, and mull their choices. Will I wait for the tanker or head to the queue? Or should I check the hand pump down the street? At home, the choices are no less onerous. Should I take a second bath in the sweltering heat? Should I cook something that consumes less water? Should I invite friends for dinner? Should I postpone an operation to save money for water? The oft-prophesised war of the 21st Century over water is already being fought in the minds of many here. The city is rife with rumour and suspicion. Is a municipal councillor diverting more tankers to his constituency? Is my neighbour bribing the tanker driver and siphoning supplies? In the fierce battles over water, two people - a volunteer managing a water queue, and a woman, exhausted by long hours in the queue - have reportedly died of heart attacks. People have come to blows in queues. To avert water riots, authorities imposed orders prohibiting large gatherings at water collection sites last month. There have been protests outside storage tanks, prompting authorities to put spiky gates on the concrete spiral stairways to prevent people from scampering up. A main police station in the city is coping with up to 20 complaints from people squabbling over water. \"People are pretty worked up over water,\" says Sudhakar Boakar, a policeman who is in charge of the station. The rich buy bottled water for drinking and private tanker supplies for cleaning and washing. The poor and not-so-well-off, spend most of their time waiting for municipality tanker supplies or queuing up outside storage tanks. \"This has been the new normal for six to eight months now,\" says councillor Shailesh Swami. \"Things worsened after the taps ran dry four months ago.\" On a still, hot night, a long queue builds outside a storage tank in the heart of the city. The roads are deserted, but the wet pavement is humming with activity. A steady stream of weary water hunters trickles in under flickering street lights. The containers - buckets, drums, bowls, pots, pitchers - squat in a queue of their own. Around midnight, Rabindra Mirkale, a factory worker, riding a moped, arrives with his nephew and 12 containers. It is a minor miracle - the number of vessels Mr Mirkale yokes to his decrepit two-wheeler; hunting water, clearly, inspires jugaad, an Indian word that means ingenious improvisation in the face of scarce resources. It's going to be a long night ahead. Mr Mirkale reckons he will get his 200 litres of water around daybreak, some six hours later. \"I work all day and collect water all night. I have no life,\" he grins. Now Sheikh Mainuddin arrives, dragging a bicycle carrying a staggering 20 containers. He's walked a kilometre in the sweltering heat. There are a dozen people in his house, he says, waiting for water. \"The once-a-week tanker water is not enough.\" There is tension as more people join the queue. An anxious mother awaits her turn, putting her child to sleep on top of a reservoir nearby. Rubbish burns on a landfill next to the tank, making the air hotter. Then suddenly, the transformer blows out, plunging the queue into darkness, completing a picture of urban dystopia. Authorities claim 125 tankers are ferrying drinking water to residents every day. Latur's senior-most official Pandurang Pole tells me at the peak of the water famine in February, the city was getting a quarter of its daily requirement of 25 million litres. Two years of paltry rainfall has reduced the main Manjara river, which supplied most of Latur's water, to a gritty mass of silt and rock. Now, Mr Pole says, the city is managing to narrow the gap by securing nearly 20 million litres a day by scrounging from every available source: two dams, a barrage, 150 bore wells, reviving a defunct water supply scheme, and most importantly, the much-talked about water train. \"It is a difficult situation,\" he says. \"We now have stocks until July and are hoping for rains this year.\" Outside the city, things are gloomier. Tankers are supplying water to 150 of the 800 villages. Groundwater levels have fallen below 500ft (152m). Desperate villagers are clambering down wells looking for dregs of water. Growing water-guzzling cash crops like sugarcane and cotton for years meant that the groundwater wasn't destined to last long in a drought-prone district of 4.5 million people. More than 30 debt-stricken farmers have taken their lives this year. But there are also stories of hope in a cruelly arid landscape. People, by and large, have been extraordinarily patient and resilient even as politicians score brownie points by sticking party posters on water tankers and taking credit for the water train. Far away from the din, local people, goaded by the Art of Living Foundation, have already contributed 30m rupees ($450,113; Â£311,487) to dredge an 18km (11-mile)-stretch of the bone-dry Manjara, the district's lifeline. Twenty dredgers are working round the clock to finish the job. \"The drying up of the river is Latur's shame,\" says Mahadev Gomare of the group. \"Nature has given us water. We should protect the sources.\" A young farmer, who bought a bore well to irrigate his dry 10-acre farm and grow corn, has instead decided to supply water free to villagers for two hours every evening. \"Crops can wait,\" says Vikas Manikrao Sul, 31, who's also a lawyer. \"Providing water to affected families is more important. In times of scarcity, you should not think of profit.\" In the long term, Latur has to conserve and harvest its water better, and change cropping patterns to avert a similar disaster. But, before that, it has to rain a lot. \"I always feel thirsty. Is that what happens to you when it doesn't rain for years?\" says Shailesh Swami, looking up at the cloudless sky.", "question": "It is 42 C in the shade , but that does n't @placeholder 10 - year - old Anjali Patole from queuing up every day near a water tank on a baking pavement in the city of Latur in the western state of Maharashtra .", "option_0": "save", "option_1": "deter", "option_2": "offer", "option_3": "lost", "option_4": "inspired", "label": 1}

Officials began releasing the raw sewage into the river just after midnight local time (05:00 GMT) on Wednesday, and say it could last about a week.

It is first literary award for Rothschild, whose book The Improbability of Love was her debut novel. She said: \"To use a word that my hero PG Wodehouse invented, I am terribly 'gruntled' by winning this prize, sharing it with the great Paul Murray.\" The Improbability of Love is about the skulduggery of the London art world. The judges described it as \"a wonderful satire on the art trade, preposterous billionaires, Russian oligarchs and much else, a brilliant conceit faultlessly carried off\". Paul Murray's third novel tells the story of two Dubliners: Claude, a banker who decides to rob his own bank and struggling novelist and crook, Paul, who helps him do it. The author said he was \"delighted and honoured\" to win the award. \"I first read PG Wodehouse as a boy and have kept returning to him ever since, longer than any other writer - which makes this award very special,\" he added. The judges said: \"Murray's setup is funny, the elegant zip of his sentences make you smile, his novel is an achingly topical, clever, delightful tale of folly and delusion.

Why the Melania plagiarism row matters Republicans react to Melania 'distraction' Teachers are thanking Melania Trump The Trump staffer said Mrs Trump had read out passages from Mrs Obama's convention speech in a phone conversation as they discussed people who inspired her. \"A person she has always liked is Michelle Obama,\" she wrote. Ms McIver later included the phrases in a draft of the speech without checking Mrs Obama's speeches, she added. \"I am honoured to work for such a great family,\" she said. Mr Trump was formally adopted as the Republican candidate for November's presidential election on Tuesday. In the aftermath of the controversy over his wife's speech, he tweeted that the publicity was good news as the speech \"got more publicity than any in the history of politics\". Mr Trump's campaign manager had emphatically denied plagiarism. Republican strategist Sean Spicer even invoked My Little Pony in an interview with CNN - citing similarities between the words of Twilight Sparkle (a purple unicorn from the children's franchise) and Mrs Trump's speech to show that the lines were \"common phrases\". Thirty-six hours later, the Trump campaign issued the press release it could have - should have - sent out in the hours after allegations of plagiarism in Melania Trump's speech first surfaced. Instead the story festered for more than a day, sucking up precious political oxygen during a week that Republicans hoped would be a showcase for the party. This will do nothing to assuage the concerns of some conservatives who wonder about the professionalism and competency of the Trump political operation. The about-face also leaves those who were ardently defending Mrs Trump over the past day and a half - such as campaign chair Paul Manafort - playing the fools.

This can lead the body to become resistant to the hormone insulin. The scientists said their findings explain why even slim people who eat too much and are inactive are at risk. And they added that a healthy diet and physical exercise is important, regardless of body weight. Insulin is a hormone that controls levels of blood sugar. When the body becomes resistant to it, levels of blood sugars and lipids rise, increasing the risk of diabetes and heart disease - but no-one is sure why insulin resistance happens and why some people become resistant when overweight, and others do not. International figures show that 43% of people who develop type 2 diabetes are obese, 43% are overweight and 14% have a healthy weight. The Cambridge study, published in Nature Genetics, found that a large proportion of the population has inherited some of 53 separate genetic variants that inhibit the storage of fat safely under the skin, particularly in the lower half of the body. Their fat is more likely to end up in the bloodstream or stored in and around the body's central organs. The study said people who have more of this genetic material are at much greater risk of type 2 diabetes - no matter what their BMI (body mass index) is. In the 20% of the population with the highest number of these genetic variants, their risk of diabetes rose by 39% compared to the 20% of the population with the lowest genetic risk. People with fat storage problems can end up with fat accumulating in and around the liver, pancreas and muscles - where it causes insulin resistance and eventually type 2 diabetes. Dr Luca Lotta, from the Medical Research Council epidemiology unit at the University of Cambridge, said that fat stored in the arms, legs and under the skin played an important role. \"Our results highlight the important biological role of peripheral fat tissue as a deposit of the surplus of energy due to overeating and lack of physical exercise.\"", "question": "Being @placeholder to store excess fat safely in the body increases the risk of type 2 diabetes , heart attacks and strokes , Cambridge University research suggests .", "option_0": "tried", "option_1": "required", "option_2": "developed", "option_3": "unable", "option_4": "known", "label": 3}

{"article": "Kenyan newspapers say there was intelligence information of an imminent attack on a school or university. Locals question why security was not heightened, with only two guards on duty at the time of the attack. Four more people have been found alive on the campus, but two are suspects and have been arrested, sources say. One is said to be a Tanzanian national with no known links to the university. All the bodies have been removed from the scene, Kenya's interior minister Joseph Nkaiserry said. Most of the victims were students, but three police officers and three soldiers were also killed, he added. Police in neighbouring Uganda say they have received information suggesting a similar attack is being planned there. Security services appear to have had some information that an attack on an institution of higher learning was in the offing and appear to have warned institutions to be careful, the Daily Nation newspaper reports. It says the University of Nairobi warned its students on 25 March that it had received intelligence information about a possible attack on a university and asked them to be vigilant. Locals in Garissa, a city about 150km from the Somali border, also question why security was not boosted in light of the intelligence. \"It's because of laxity by the government that these things are happening. For something like this to happen when there are those rumours is unacceptable,\" said Mohamed Salat, 47, a Somali Kenyan businessman. One of the survivors, who hid in bushes during the assault, said the students had raised security issues late last year, but only two armed guards had been provided. Another said the gunmen appeared to know the site well. One witness told the BBC she heard the gunman receiving instructions on mobile phones, and speaking in Swahili, an official language in Kenya - raising the possibility the attackers were locals and not from Somalia, al-Shabab's heartland. A dusk to dawn curfew has now been imposed in Garissa and three nearby counties. In his address to the nation after the attack, President Uhuru Kenyatta said he had instructed the police chief to speed up the training of 10,000 recruits, because Kenya had \"suffered unnecessarily due to shortage of security personnel\". Al-Shabab was also blamed for the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi in 2013 in which 67 people died. President Barack Obama has expressed his condolences, saying \"words cannot adequately condemn\" what had happened. The UN too expressed its outrage, paying tribute to Kenya's role in the African Union's mission in neighbouring Somalia against al-Shabab. The bodies of those killed in Garissa have been flown to the capital Nairobi for identification, as the local mortuaries have been unable to cope, and many of the students killed came from other parts of the country. The masked attackers killed two security guards at dawn on Thursday, then rampaged through campus, shooting and shouting \"we are al-Shabab\". They singled out Christians and shot them, witnesses said. At the scene: Wanyama wa Chebusiri, BBC Africa, Garissa: A second-year student who hid for 10 hours in a wardrobe is one of about 500 survivors still being held at a military facility, where they are undergoing counselling. Her father drove for four hours from Nairobi when he was unable to get hold of her during the siege. He told the BBC about his desperate search for his daughter at the mortuary, hospital and military airstrip. Late in the afternoon, when he had almost given up hope, he got a text: \"Dad call me\". They have yet to be reunited but his relief is palpable. Who are the victims? Eyewitnesses describe attack Why is al-Shabab targeting Kenya? While many of the survivors spoke to the media, little is known so far about those who were killed. The BBC's Frenny Jowi says Kenyan media are cautious in their coverage because of a new anti-terror law that stipulates heavy fines for material \"likely to cause fear\". Garissa university campus 1.

The gunmen were eventually cornered in a dormitory by Kenyan security forces. Four of them died when their suicide vests detonated. A fifth gunman was reportedly arrested. Al-Shabab, which is linked to al-Qaeda, said it carried out the attack. The group says it is at war with Kenya, which sent troops to Somalia in 2011 to fight the militants. The Kenyan government has offered a reward of $53,000 (Â£36,000) for the man it says planned the killing - Mohamed Kuno, a former Kenyan schoolteacher, now thought to be in Somalia.

{"article": "Some 450,000 asylum seekers have entered Germany already this year and up to a million are expected in 2015 - by far the most in the EU. The government in Berlin has broadly welcomed refugees, relaxing EU rules so that it no longer sends back Syrians to other EU countries. But it introduced temporary border controls on Sunday after admitting that its capacity had been stretched to the limit. Until now, the federal government has insisted it can cope with the high numbers of asylum seekers but wants the burden shared between EU countries. Authorities have been giving assistance to new arrivals at stations in Munich and other German cities before taking them to reception centres. The \"Koenigsteiner Key\" is used to distribute asylum seekers across Germany's 16 federal states, calculated according to their tax revenue and their population. For example, North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, will be expected to take 21% of all asylum seekers, while Thuringia, the focus of several attacks on asylum accommodation, is set to receive under 3%. With a huge build-up of asylum seekers in the Bavarian city of Munich, and reception centres apparently reaching capacity, authorities in affected states have been calling for the federal government in Berlin to do more. Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann told radio station Bayern 2 that stricter controls were needed because \"many en route here are not really refugees\". \"It's got about in the last few days that you are successful if everyone claims to be Syrian,\" he added. The dispute has seen Chancellor Angela Merkel come under increasing pressure particularly from political allies in the Christian Social Union (CSU), which has ruled Bavaria, Germany's wealthiest state, for nearly 60 years. State Premier Horst Seehofer described the decision to open the borders as \"a mistake that will occupy us for a long time\". German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel told Tagesspiegel newspaper on Sunday that the problem was \"not the number of refugees but the rapidity at which they arrived\". He said \"Europe's inaction in the refugee crisis had driven Germany... to the limit of its capacity\". The government ordered police to begin checking travel documents on Sunday from anyone entering from the southern frontier with Austria, and federal police set up roadblocks on motorway networks. Rail services to Munich were affected by the changes, too. German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the border controls would remain in place until further notice. \"The aim of this measure is to limit the current influx to Germany and to return to orderly entry procedures,\" he said. \"This is also urgently necessary for security reasons.\" The move goes against the principle of the Schengen zone, which allows free movement between many European countries. However, the Schengen agreement does allow for temporary suspensions. There have been warnings that the restrictions could make conditions worse for the thousands of migrants continuing to make the perilous journey across Europe to Germany. \"These measures will not create more order but only much more chaos,\" said Katrin Goering-Eckhardt, the parliamentary leader of the opposition Greens, according to Reuters. But the government argues that the new measures will not affect the rights of refugees coming to Germany. The temporary border controls were introduced hours before an emergency meeting of European interior ministers and Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said they were \"a signal to Europe\". \"Germany is facing up to its humanitarian responsibility, but the burdens connected with the large number of refugees must be distributed in solidarity,\" he said. EU ministers were to vote on a May 2015 plan to redistribute an initial 40,000 asylum seekers from Syria and Eritrea through mandatory quotas. The EU has since raised the total number of people it seeks to share out through quotas to 160,000 asylum seekers across 23 EU states. But Germany says this still is not enough. Speaking in the German parliament last week, the vice chancellor described the plans as \"a first step, if one wants to be polite\". \"Or you could call it a drop in the ocean.\" An application for asylum is made at the reception centre on arrival, where personal details, fingerprints and photographs (for those over 14) are taken. A temporary permission to stay is granted. The asylum seeker will then be invited to an interview to decide his or her case. The current average time from application to decision is 5.3 months, according to the German government. If granted refugee status, a residence permit for three years will be granted. After this time a permanent residence permit can be applied for. Germany designates all EU states plus Ghana, Senegal, Serbia, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina as \"safe countries of origin\" - which means that asylum claims from nationals of these countries are likely to be rejected. On 7 September the government announced that Kosovo, Albania and Montenegro would be added to this list. Asylum seekers normally stay at reception centres for up to six weeks. After that they are offered either communal accommodation, or housed individually, depending on the policy of the federal state. People who are unable to support themselves financially \"receive what they need for their day-to-day life\", the German government says. Support varies from state to state, but generally includes non-cash benefits covering food and accommodation costs, plus limited spending money. After being in the country for three months, asylum seekers can apply for permission to start work, subject to various restrictions. Anyone given a residence permit has unrestricted access to the labour market after four years. No - Germany has a long and complicated history of population movement. After Germany's defeat in World War Two, millions of ethnic Germans were forced to leave areas of Poland, former Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and Russia and resettle in West and East Germany. The booming economy of post-war West Germany required more workers, and huge numbers of \"guest workers\" arrived from Mediterranean countries such as Italy, Spain and - most significantly - Turkey. Communist East Germany also took on temporary workers from \"fraternal socialist countries\", including North Vietnam, Cuba and Mozambique, although most returned after German reunification. In 1991 the country enacted laws enabling Jews from the former Soviet Union to move to Germany - more than 200,000 Jewish people and their families immigrated in this way. Around 350,000 people fleeing the Bosnian conflict were given temporary refuge in Germany in the 1990s, but most have since left. In total, 20.3% of Germany's population now have \"a migration background\" - the term German officialdom uses to describe immigrants or their children.

{"article": "The proposals are specifically aimed at reducing the high rates of teenage smokers in France. Health Minister Marisol Touraine plans to follow Australia's example, which introduced similar measures in 2012. Experts say removing branding on packets and adding large health warnings reduced smoking in Australia. However, some tobacco companies dispute the evidence for this and say France's plans are incomprehensible. Smoking is the main cause of death in France, with more than 70,000 people dying each year of tobacco-related illnesses. The new measures, which will come into effect once the law goes through the National Assembly, also includes a ban on smoking in children's play areas in public parks and in cars carrying children under 12. In addition, advertising of e-cigarettes will be restricted before being banned in May 2016, except at the point of sale and in trade publications. Ms Touraine says there are 13 million smokers in France - which has a population of around 66 million - and the \"number of smokers is growing, especially among young people.\" \"We can't accept that tobacco kills 73,000 people every year in our country - the equivalent of a plane crash every day with 200 people on board,\" she added. The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says the move goes well beyond what France is required to do under European anti-smoking rules. EU laws already force tobacco firms to cover 65% of the packaging with health warnings, but Ms Touraine said they would be \"the same shape, same size, same colour, same typeset\" if the ban came into effect. Celine Audibert, a spokeswoman for French firm Seita, which is a subsidiary of Imperial Tobacco, described the move as \"completely incomprehensible\". \"It's based on the Australian experience which, more than a failure, was a complete fiasco,\" added Ms Audibert. In 2012, Australia forced all cigarettes to be sold in identical brown packets, largely covered with graphic health warnings. Tobacco clearances, an indicator of tobacco volumes in the Australian market, fell 3.4% in 2013 compared with 2012.

Rosberg suffered the same issue - but his struck while he was still in the pits, so it did not affect his session. \"I'm really struggling for words after that session,\" said Hamilton. \"I try to turn it positive. I'm grateful I could get going again, I was really happy with my lap. \"It was lap four of those tyres so they weren't at peak performance, but I did my best with what I had.\" Hamilton added: \"It makes a big difference when you have a banker lap and work on it and build on it.\" He explained that his final run had not gone to plan either, as he encountered traffic on his first attempt at a flying lap, and was then told to do two further slow laps before his last attempt to ensure he did not have the same problem again. \"It cost me pole. My state of mind is to at least finish where I am. If I can gain another position, that would be great. I am just hoping the car stays together [in the race].\" It is the latest in a string of problems that have afflicted Hamilton this season, while Rosberg won the first four races.

Mrs Coriam, 52, added the family had been \"in limbo\" ever since disappearance of her daughter, known as Bex. Rebecca had been working organising children's activities and games on the 83,000-tonne Disney Wonder, sailing off Mexico's Pacific coast. She was last seen on Tuesday, 22 March 2011 at about 05:45 GMT, when CCTV footage showed her making a phone call to her friend from the staff quarters. Four hours later the alarm was raised when she failed turn up for the start of her shift. Despite a search of the ship and the efforts of the Mexican coastguard, she was not found. As the Coriams flew to Los Angeles from their home in rural Cheshire three days after Rebecca was reported missing, they were told in advance by cruise officials they would be treated \"Disney-style\". In hindsight, Rebecca's parents said \"Disney-style\" meant a tightly-controlled visit to the ship before it set sail again. \"We were met with a car with blacked-out windows,\" said Mrs Coriam. \"It was obvious they did not want us to leave the hotel alone,\" added her husband. They met with the captain and officials from Disney in a small room on board the ship where they were shown the CCTV footage of their daughter. \"We asked if we could have a copy and we were told 'no',\" said Mrs Coriam. The couple said they had no opportunity to question the crew. Instead, they said they were shown her room, the staff quarters and to Deck Five, where they said officials put forward a theory that Rebecca had been swept overboard by a wave. However, the Coriams said they had doubts that was possible and said as the deck was in front of the ship's bridge, they believed someone would have seen what had happened to their daughter. When they looked around the dock in LA where the ship was berthed, they said they showed Rebecca's picture to one worker. \"He told us he remembered her loading her luggage but then she said, 'you never saw me',\" Mr Coriam said. The family's Miami-based lawyer Jim Walker, who specialises in maritime law, said he had been \"deeply troubled\" by the \"lack of co-operation and transparency demonstrated by Disney\". He added: \"In this day and age it is inconceivable that anyone would vanish from a cruise ship - particularly a ship catering to families and children - without the circumstances being recorded by closed circuit television cameras.\" In a statement, Disney said: \"Our hearts go out to the Coriams. Rebecca's disappearance has been heartbreaking for everyone at Disney Cruise Line. \"We wish we knew what happened.\" They said the family's next frustration came with trying to get information between the Royal Bahamas Police, called in because the ship was registered in the Bahamas, and Cheshire Police. They said progress was slow and they had not heard any updates for some time. However, Sgt Chrislyn Skippings, public affairs officer for the Royal Bahamas Police, insisted the investigation was ongoing. The family's supporters have set up a fundraising campaign through Facebook and the couple are in touch with other relatives who have lost loved ones at sea along with sea safety campaigners. They have also found themselves offering support to others in the same situation. Rebecca's parents are now also campaigning for UK authorities to be able investigate cases of British nationals who go missing on vessels registered abroad. At some stage they plan to go to the US to resume their investigation and quest for the truth. But, in the meantime - to mark the first anniversary of the disappearance - family and friends are gathering for a special Mass at St Werbergh's Roman Catholic Church, Chester, to pray for Rebecca, whose 25th birthday was on 11 March.

HBO is not the only broadcaster to have been caught out by its own technology. Sky Deutschland accidentally uploaded episode 14 of Twin Peaks: The Return to its streaming platform on 7 August, instead of episode 13.

{"article": "St George's says the checks would help tackle health tourism and would only be for non-urgent patients - emergency cases would get automatic care. It says such a move is in line with what guidelines recommend. But critics say the checks could be potentially dangerous. St George's says it has a duty to use resources wisely, as well as provide care and treatment to patients requiring the hospital's services. The hospital has a high number of patients from overseas who are not eligible for NHS treatment. The government said a pilot was a good idea and it would be keen to see the results. The trust's board papers from October make clear that \"if no action is taken, from December 2016 the cost of health care given to non-eligible patients could be Â£4m-Â£5m per annum\". Currently, antenatal ward staff ask patients to fill in forms with proof of eligibility, including passport details or other ID, when they book in for care. But some patients leave these parts of the form blank. The hospital says it wants to tighten up its checks. A spokesman for St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: \"Like many London Trusts, we treat a high number of patients from overseas who are not eligible for NHS treatment. \"The guidelines state that hospitals should endeavour to check patients for their eligibility when accessing non-emergency NHS treatment. We are not doing this effectively enough at present, and are looking at ways in which we can improve this.\" Others are not convinced. Cathy Warwick of the Royal College of Midwives said: \"I would ask the trust to clarify their policy and to give assurances that all pregnant women who need care will receive it, no matter what their immigration status. \"To be clear, the law says, and government policy states, that trusts must offer care to women in labour, irrespective of their immigration status in the country.\" She said the move could be dangerous because \"it could deter women from seeking care in a timely fashion. This could potentially have a serious impact on the health of the mother and their baby and the outcome of the pregnancy.\" A Department of Health spokesperson said: \"NHS Trusts and Foundation Trusts in England are legally obliged to check whether patients are eligible for non-emergency NHS treatment free at the point of use, and recover costs from the overseas patients who are not normally resident in the UK where charges apply.

The 56-year-old, who was just 10 when the high-camp TV series began in 1966, said it \"was a dream come true\". The Batmobile design was based on a 1955 Lincoln Futura, a concept car built in Italy by the Ford Motor Company. It was the first time that car had come up for public sale since it was bought in 1965 by car-customiser George Barris for a nominal fee of $1. Barris then spent $15,000 (roughly £5,370 at the time) to transform it into the famous superhero vehicle, over a period of 15 days. It had a V-8 engine,  arguably one of the first in-car phones, and parachutes, which were deployed to help Batman turn sharp corners. Mr Barris told reporters at the auction: \"The car had to be a star on its own. And it became one.\" Since the show was cancelled in 1968, he  has toured the Batmobile and was eventually housed in a private showroom in California. Adam West,  now 84, played the caped crusader in 120 episodes in four years of programming, with Burt Ward starring as the \"boy wonder\" Robin and comedian and actor Cesar Romero as Batman's arch nemesis, The Joker. The 60s show was camp in its portrayal of Batman. More recent incarnations of billionaire Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego - such as British director Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy  - have had a much darker tone.

{"article": "Nestle had challenged the ban ordered by the country's food safety regulator in June after some tests found lead levels beyond statutory limits. The Swiss food multinational has always said its products are safe. Thursday's ruling came a day after India separately sued Nestle for $100m (Â£64m) over \"unfair trade practices\". The complaint against Nestle is that it caused damage to consumers through misleading advertisements related to its Maggi noodles product. On Thursday, the Bombay High Court called June's ban on the popular noodles \"arbitrary\" and said it violated the \"principles of natural justice\". \"We have examined the evidence in great detail. Since the petitioner Nestle has already agreed not to make and sell Maggi until the food authorities are satisfied, we see no reason to allow any relief to food authorities,\" Justice Vidyasagar Kanade was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. The court directed Nestle to \"send five samples from each batch of Maggi [noodles] for testing to three labs and only if the lead is found to be lower than permitted will they start manufacturing and sale again\". The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) had earlier said that tests deemed the instant noodles to contain \"unsafe and hazardous\" amounts of lead. Nestle says its noodles are safe as seen in the results of tests conducted in other countries, including the US, Britain and Singapore. Two Indian laboratories in the western state of Goa and the southern city of Mysore also recently cleared the noodles, but the findings were dismissed by India's food safety authority, saying there were lapses in the tests. Nestle said in statement on Wednesday that it had tested 2,700 samples of the noodles by several accredited laboratories in India and abroad, and each of these tests \"have shown lead to be far below the permissible limits\". But the company, which has 80% of India's instant noodles market, has already destroyed 400 million packets of Maggi products. The instant noodles arrived in India in 1983 and can be found in corner shops across the country.

It incorporates and dissolves limited companies, registers the information companies are legally required to supply and makes that information available to the public. There are more than 3m limited companies registered in the UK - and 500,000 new companies are incorporated each year. Under the Companies Act 2006, an individual found guilty of filing false documents to Companies House could receive a prison term of up to two years, a fine, or both. In a statement, Companies House said Charlton had not signed up to a scheme which \"would prevent false or fraudulent submissions being made\". A section of Charlton supporters are calling on owner Roland Duchatelet to sell the club, having questioned his motives since he took over the Championship side in January 2014. The club, managed by Belgian Jose Riga, is currently bottom of the table, four points from safety with 16 matches remaining. Some fans formed a group called Coalition Against Roland Duchatelet (CARD), which has organised a series of protests at matches at The Valley, primarily aimed at Duchatelet and Meire. However, 69-year-old Belgian businessman Duchatelet, who has a network of clubs in Europe, insists the Addicks are not for sale.

{"article": "That's the verdict from a former colleague of the civil servant who now effectively controls the purse strings in Northern Ireland. In the absence of a sitting executive, it is perhaps fitting that the man now in control of a budget of more than £10bn is called Sterling. Failure by politicians to fix the budget crisis has brought David Sterling centre stage - never the most comfortable of places for any civil servant. On Wednesday, the most senior civil servant at the Department of Finance gains control of a sum of money equivalent to 75% of this year's budget. Section 59 of the Northern Ireland Act allows him to use that money \"for such services and purposes\" as he directs. Numbers come naturally to the civil service lifer who has been permanent secretary at the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) for the past year. Mr Sterling joined the civil service in 1978 and has progressed up the ranks, first to permanent secretary of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) in 2009 and then onto DFP. He was permanent secretary at DETI when the botched Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme was set up in 2012. \"He is one of the very few people in the civil service who has gone from entry level at the bottom to the very top,\" said one person who works with him. In both cases, he has worked alongside former first minister Arlene Foster. He was a central figure in staging the successful G8 summit in Fermanagh in 2013. He is described by a colleague as \"a consensus builder and, as such, is highly regarded\". Mr Sterling was also permanent secretary at DETI when the botched Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme was set up in 2012. The scheme, which is about £490m over budget, resulted in a scandal that played a major role in the collapse of Stormont's institutions in January. Another observation - garnered from inside one of Northern Ireland's quangos - is that he is \"canny\" and \"a bit of a Mr Grey\" - both qualities that go a long way in the upper levels of the civil service. His interests include cycling, walking and golf.

But the Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust, a beneficiary of the estate, said the scheme would not weed out fake claims and too much money would go to lawyers. Appeal judges dismissed the challenge. The court also rejected the trust's application for NatWest to be dismissed as the executor of Savile's estate. Meanwhile, abuse survivors who met Home Secretary Theresa May on Monday said the government was creating £2m fund for groups helping people who will give evidence to the forthcoming public inquiry into abuse, and a separate £1.5m fund for charities which help abuse survivors. The National Association for People Abused in Childhood said it was represented at the meeting, but the Home Office has not yet announced any details. Court of Appeal judges heard that Savile, who died in October 2011, was accused of being a \"serial child abuser and sex offender\" in a documentary broadcast in October 2012. The former BBC presenter was also alleged to have abused people in hospitals. The court heard that a \"large number\" of people had come forward to say they were abused by him following the programme. The number of people making compensation claims was now more than 200, lawyers said. In February, victims were advised that, under the compensation scheme, they could make claims against the Savile estate, the BBC or the NHS, with payments capped at £60,000. Experts initially put the value of Savile's estate at around £4m. But a \"range of expenses\" was incurred and the estate's value was reduced to about £3.3m, judges said in February. Liz Dux, a lawyer at law firm Slater & Gordon which represents victims, said: \"Today's ruling will bring great relief to Savile's many victims who have been living with the uncertainty of not knowing whether they would be blocked in their claims. \"They just want some recognition of what they have been through so they can then be able to move on with their lives.

Artemisinin resistance has been known about for years, but a recent rise in resistance to piperaquine as well means the main malaria treatment, taking both together, is starting to fail. International groups of researchers analysed the DNA from hundreds of malaria parasites to find out how they learned to shrug off piperaquine. They uncovered genetic signatures unique to the parasites that were drug-resistant. Dr Roberto Amato, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, told the BBC News website: \"Resistance is quite widespread, there has been almost complete failure in one province in the western part of the country, and it is spreading quiet fast in the north of the country. \"The problem with complete failure is this might accelerate the spread of drug-resistance to other countries and ultimately to Africa.\" Resistance to the drugs would be catastrophic in Africa, where 88% of all malaria cases happen. Dr Amato added: \"The good news is we're starting to get clues on which treatment to use.\" Curiously, these resistant parasites appear to still be susceptible to an older drug - mefloquine. One theory is that the malaria parasites cannot resist both mefloquine and piperaquine, so doctors may be able to rotate which drugs are used. And for Dr Amato, the long-term aim is to be able to keep one step ahead of the parasite. He said: \"They evolve every single day to escape the human immune system and the insect immune system - they're extremely good at it - and we need to understand that. \"Understanding how and in which direction is crucial, if we understand the process from most basic level then we could at some point predict the direction it is going to evolve.\" Prof David Conway, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \"These studies are a big step forward in our understanding. \"This evolving parasite resistance is a major threat for malaria control internationally.\" Follow James on Twitter.", "question": "Scientists have developed a way to track the spread of a @placeholder form of malaria that can not be treated with the main therapy .", "option_0": "popular", "option_1": "certain", "option_2": "powerful", "option_3": "novel", "option_4": "dangerous", "label": 4}

In an interview for the Washington Post, he refused to endorse House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator John McCain, who are up for re-election in November. Amid the feuding within Republican ranks, prominent party donor and fundraiser Meg Whitman has publicly endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton, saying Donald Trump's \"demagoguery\" had undermined the national fabric. \"To vote Republican out of party loyalty alone would be to endorse a candidacy that I believe has exploited anger, grievance, xenophobia and racial division,\" she wrote on Facebook. \"Trump's unsteady hand would endanger our prosperity and national security. His authoritarian character could threaten much more.\" In other developments: French President Francois Hollande joined the chorus of criticism on Tuesday, saying that Mr Trump made people \"feel nauseous\". He warned that a Trump presidential election victory could herald  a very strong turn to the right around the world. Speaking to Fox, Mr Trump said Mr Obama had been \"the worst president, maybe, in the history of our country\". Mr Trump has also been condemned for his comments that appeared to back the Russian annexation of Crimea. But he retorted: \"I believe I know far more about foreign policy than he [Mr Obama] knows. \"Look at Ukraine. He talks about Ukraine [and] how tough he is with Russia. In the meantime they took over Crimea.\" Mr Obama and Mrs Clinton, his one-time secretary of state, had \"destabilised the Middle East\" while putting the \"country at risk\" with Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server, he said. Mr Trump is under fire for attacking the parents of a dead US Muslim soldier after they criticised him at the Democratic convention last week. At the convention, Khizr Khan, whose son died while serving in Iraq, criticised Mr Trump's plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the US. Mr Trump responded by attacking the couple - who are called in the US a \"Gold Star\" family, the term for families that have lost a close relative in war. Democratic and Republican leaders as well as veterans' groups quickly condemned him. \"The Republican nominee is unfit to serve as president and he keeps on proving it,\" Mr Obama said on Tuesday. \"The notion that he would attack a Gold Star family that made such extraordinary sacrifices... means that he is woefully unprepared to do this job.\" New York Representative Richard Hanna became the first Republican member of Congress to publicly say he would vote for Mrs Clinton. Mr Hanna said Mr Trump's comments about the Khan family had been the deciding factor. Until recently, many Republicans opposed to Mr Trump had stopped short of supporting Mrs Clinton, saying they would vote for a third party or \"write-in\" candidate.", "question": "Donald Trump has dismissed Barack Obama 's time in the White House as a \" disaster \" after the US president said he was not fit to @placeholder him .", "option_0": "represent", "option_1": "support", "option_2": "succeed", "option_3": "face", "option_4": "defend", "label": 2}
{"article": "Retired Vice-Admiral Robert Harward was widely tipped for the post after Mr Trump fired Michael Flynn on Monday. A White House official said Mr Harward cited family and financial commitments, but US media said the sticking point was he wanted to bring in his own team. Mr Flynn had misled US Vice-President Mike Pence over his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the US. The latest setback emerged hours after Mr Trump robustly denied media reports of White House disarray, insisting his administration was running like a \"fine-tuned machine\". Mr Harward told the Associated Press the Trump administration was \"very accommodating to my needs, both professionally and personally\". \"It's purely a personal issue,\" added the 60-year-old former Navy Seal who is currently based in Abu Dhabi as an executive for US defence contractor Lockheed Martin. Asked about reports that he had asked to bring in his own staff at the National Security Council, Mr Harward said: \"I think that's for the president to address.\" Mr Flynn, a retired army lieutenant-general, was ousted amid claims that before he was even appointed as national security adviser he had discussed sanctions with a Russian envoy. This would have potentially breached a law banning private citizens from engaging in diplomacy. Mr Flynn initially denied having discussed sanctions with Sergei Kislyak, Moscow's ambassador to Washington. But on Monday, Mr Trump asked for his resignation following revelations that Mr Flynn had misled the vice-president about his conversations with the diplomat. Leading Republicans have called for an investigation into intelligence leaks that led to Mr Flynn's resignation. Two other contenders - retired General David Petraeus and acting national security adviser Keith Kellogg - have also been tipped to take on the job. Mr Kellogg, a retired three-star general, was named acting national security advisor after Mr Flynn stepped down. The 72-year-old had a long career in the US Army, serving in Vietnam and Iraq, before retiring in 2003 and becoming a security consultant for software giant Oracle Corp. Mr Petraeus, a celebrated former four-star general, retired as CIA director in 2012 after it emerged he had given top-secret material to his biographer, with whom he was also having an extramarital affair.

Earlier, the Black Caps were dismissed for 317 in their first innings, Kane Williamson top-scoring with 140. Williamson frustrated the hosts' attack until halfway through the second session of the day, posting his 11th Test hundred and his first against Australia. Mitchell Starc eventually dismissed him to finish with 4-57, with fellow left-arm paceman Mitchell Johnson taking 3-105. Australia captain Steve Smith decided not to enforce the follow-on, despite leading by 239 on first innings. New Zealand's attack toiled without quick bowler Tim Southee, who was forced off the field on day two with an irritated disc in his back.

{"article": "In a speech on Thursday, the health secretary said it was \"critical for patient safety\". The target of seeing 95% of patients in four hours has been missed in England since July 2015. There was a record low of 85.1% in January. Mr Hunt demanded progress this year and said the target should be hit next year after new funding in the Budget. Chancellor Philip Hammond announced an extra £2bn for social care over the next three years. This comes after warnings services were under threat with councils, which are in charge of services, reportedly £1bn short of the £19.7bn they need this year. Mr Hunt said the new money would help tackle the problem of patients who were fit to leave hospital having discharge delayed because of a lack of suitable care in the community. This is thought to have contributed to overcrowding in trusts. The health secretary said: \"It is absolutely essential we get back to the 95% target. That is critical for patient safety.\" To coincide with Mr Hunt's speech, bosses at NHS England and NHS Improvement, which run the health service, wrote to hospital chief executives giving them a deadline of March 2018 to get back on track. They said the social care money would play an important part in relieving the pressure as it could help to free up between 2,000 and 3,000 beds which are occupied by patients who have finished their treatment. If this is achieved it would represent a halving of the delays that are currently being seen. But the two regulators also want hospitals and the ambulance service to take some steps themselves. These include: The development comes after ministers and NHS bosses have given serious consideration to dropping or changing the target. Earlier this winter Mr Hunt suggested it was being looked at amid concerns the growing numbers seeking care at A&E units was making it very difficult for hospitals to hit the target.

{"article": "Spieth remains deadly accurate on the greens but Els struggles to hole the most straightforward putts. It is a sad scenario, yet the 46-year-old's enduring love of this maddening game can only be admired. Back in 2003, Els shot 31 under par to win the Mercedes Championship in Hawaii. It became the benchmark for Spieth to aim at last weekend as he romped to his eight-stroke victory in the PGA Tour's Champions Tournament. The young Texan came up only a stroke shy of Els' record as he laid down an impressive marker for the coming year. Just 22, he now has seven titles to his name and more will surely be added to the list. These are tough times for the four-time major champion as he grapples with those demons on the greens. Els was once such an elegant putter. His poise matched the grace, tempo and power of his long game. These qualities were evident to anyone who watched him win the 1994 and 1997 US Opens. On the tough layouts at Oakmont and Congressional, Els made the game look ridiculously easy. He was just 24 when he grabbed the first of those majors and back then anyone suggesting he would win only three more would have been given short shrift. Of course, Tiger Woods had yet to emerge and Els became one of the 14-time major champion's first big rivals to be taken down. Regular defeats at Woods' hands inflicted serious damage to the South African's golfing psyche. However, he still won the 2002 Open at Muirfield before taking advantage of Adam Scott's late capitulation to claim a second claret jug a decade later. This week I find myself recalling events of a year earlier, at Royal St George's. There I caught sight of Els battling through the wind and rain of the 2011 Championship, totally out of contention. The thought struck me: \"Why is he bothering?\" After all, he was about to celebrate his 42nd birthday having enjoyed a largely glittering career. He had made a fortune and there must be more to his life than this. But that discounted the competitive instincts that put the millions in Els' bank account. It didn't take account of a fire that still burned inside and a year later his persistence was more than vindicated with his victory at Royal Lytham. It was achieved with a belly-putter wedged into his midriff, a method that brought him a second life on the greens.  It is a technique no longer available, with the ban on anchored putting having been brought in at the start of this year. The R&A and the United States Golf Association (USGA) wanted to remove a crucial crutch from those unable to control involuntary hand spasms often acquired from a mileage of missed putts. So the governing bodies legislated to sort the wheat from the chaff, handing an advantage to those players who don't need to attach putters to a pivot point to make a stroke. Manfully Els has sought to embrace the demands of the new rules, but ditching the belly putter has been a painful experience. How embarrassing it must have been to become an internet sensation when he failed to hit the hole from short range during last autumn's Alfred Dunhill Links Championship. An unforgiving Twittersphere called it \"the worst putt ever\". Those who witnessed the Carnoustie calamity first hand were more sympathetic, including Ken Brown, the author of the excellent book 'One Putt' which examines the art of this most frustrating aspect of the game. \"It is gut wrenching isn't it,\" Brown said during his television commentary. \"Especially when you have been as good as he has.\" The former European Ryder Cup player notes in his book: \"It is very difficult to achieve consistency at impact without your hands working in harmony.\" Alas there was little melody in the movement of Els' mitts last week when he missed the cut at the South African Open. The second round ended with a miserable three putt. Remember this is someone with 70 worldwide wins to his name and still he will persevere. \"I love the game too much,\" he insisted. \"I'm not going to stop. I'm going to get over this by using the cross-handed method and still have fun out there.\" Els is down to 194 in the world rankings. These are desperate times; the game is anything but easy and we can only wish him well.

{"article": "Instead, doctors will be allowed to prioritise patients, affecting up to 189m consultations a year. Changes will also be made to the four-hour A&E and 18-week hospital treatment waiting time targets. Health Secretary Andrew Lansley announced the moves, which represent a major shift in policy from Labour. The previous government used targets as a way of driving through improvement. But in the lead up to the election the Tories claimed it was time to move away from the target culture and instead focus more on the quality of treatment. Mr Lansley said: \"I want to free the NHS from bureaucracy and targets that have no clinical justification and move to an NHS which measures its performance on patient outcomes. \"Doctors will be free to focus on the outcomes that matter - providing quality patient care.\" GPs have long complained the 48-hour target can put the most seriously-ill patients at risk as appointments get clogged up with people who do not need immediate access. Dr Laurence Buckman, of the British Medical Association, said: \"We would welcome the scrapping of this target as it will give GPs greater flexibility to organise their appointment booking system in a way that best suits their local patient population.\" But the Patients Association said it was concerned about the speed of the changes. Spokeswoman Katherine Murphy said while moving away from targets was the \"right idea\", it was important to have something in place first to stop a \"free for all\". The changes in the other areas are seen as much less radical. The hospital waiting target move is more relevant to managers than patients. The guidance makes it clear hospitals will still be expected to see patients in 18 weeks, but they will not have to prove it to local managers, meaning less paper-work. Meanwhile, the threshold for seeing A&E patients within four hours will be lowered from 98% of patients to 95%. The move is just the start of what will be a complete change in how performance is managed in emergency departments. A new measurement is likely to be introduced, which is likely to include an element of waiting alongside other factors such as access to scans. The idea, again, is to focus on quality rather than just what is deemed to be the rather blunt instrument of waiting time. In the guidance issued to the NHS in England, Mr Lansley also makes it clear that these changes can help save money on management - 46% in the coming years.

{"article": "The invention, created by Prof David Lentink's research team, measures the force produced by every wing flap. The device, described in the Royal Society journal Interface, will enable researchers to carry out tests of miniature drones, to assess more precisely their flight performance. It has also answered a physics riddle. This question, Prof Lentink explained, is whether a container or a truck carrying birds changes in weight when the birds inside were flying. It was investigated in an episode of the US television show MythBusters; the presenters weighed a trailer while birds flew inside it, and concluded that it was no different to when the birds were still. This new device, however, is so precise, that it shows that this is not quite right; the weight of the container would actually change as the birds flapped their wings. The Stanford team explained that measurements taken from a single bird showed that hovering created \"double the lift during the downstroke [of the wings] so that the birds did not have to lift their weight during the upstroke\". \"So, the weight of a truck containing just a few flying birds will fluctuate in time; only the lift of an incoherent flock of birds could cancel out [this change],\" Prof Lentink summarised. He and his colleagues tested their new device by recording the tiny forces from a single bird flying inside the specially designed chamber. For their demonstration, the scientists trained two Pacific parrotlets (named Gaga and Ray) to fly from one perch to another inside the device. The birds would receive a food reward \"and we get its aerodynamic forces in return\", explained Prof Lentink. \"The method is extremely fast and precise, which helps us measure the forces animals and drones generate to manoeuvre.\" By measuring these forces so accurately, Prof Lentink explained, researchers will be able to fine-tune miniature drones as they fly freely inside the chamber.", "question": "Scientists at Stanford University in the US have developed a super - @placeholder device that can measure the weight of a bird in flight .", "option_0": "resistant", "option_1": "powerful", "option_2": "heavy", "option_3": "sized", "option_4": "sensitive", "label": 4}

The ship is expected to go into service next year and will be used for counter-terrorism, anti-smuggling and defence. The MoD said work on HMS Forth and her sister ships was sustaining 800 Scottish jobs. The vessels will be equipped with a 30mm cannon, a flight deck capable of accommodating a Merlin helicopter, and will be manned by a crew of 58 sailors. It is the first of a fleet of new Batch 2 River-class OPVs being built on the Clyde, which are all expected to be in service by 2021. Their construction has filled a gap in the order books of the Govan yard, where work is due to begin on eight Type 26 frigates this summer. The Type 26 frigate, which is principally designed for anti-submarine warfare, will partially replace the current Type 23 frigate. Each ship will carry a crew of 118, have a top speed of more than 26 knots and a range of 7,000 nautical miles. The first vessel is due to enter service in the early 2020s. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said that the work would safeguard hundreds of skilled jobs until 2035. HMS Forth, the fifth Royal Navy vessel to bear the name over the past two centuries, is affiliated with the city of Stirling. The MoD said the name maintained a connection that began when the people of the city adopted a previous ship with the name Forth during World War Two.

The fund, which is expected to have cost £1.27bn by April 2017, has helped more than 80,000 cancer patients. Before any drugs can be given to patients on the NHS, they have to be recommended by the health watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which looks at how well they work and whether they are cost-effective. But if drugs are not recommended or have yet to be appraised by NICE, the Cancer Drugs Fund can step in and choose to fund cancer treatment. The fund was initially managed by strategic health authorities. But since April 2013, it has been managed by NHS England. The MPs' committee says there is no evidence the fund is benefiting patients, extending lives or a good use of taxpayers' money. Money has had to be diverted from primary care to cover two years of overspends. The £480m budget for the two years from 2013 to 2015 was overspent by £167m.

Judge Gerald Fisher granted a motion for the new trial on Thursday, after his lawyers said a key witness gave misleading testimony. The case claimed the career of Democratic politician Gary Condit, to whom Ms Levy was romantically linked. Ms Levy, 24, had just finished an internship with the US Bureau of Prisons when she disappeared. Her body was found in Rock Creek Park in Washington DC more than a year later. Prosecutors told Judge Fisher that the \"passage of time and the unique circumstances of this case\" made it hard to oppose a new trial. Lawyers for Guandique and the prosecutors will appear in court next week, when a new trial date will be set. In 2013, prosecutors requested a new trial because they had issues with a key witness, Armando Morales, Guandique's one-time cellmate. Guandique's lawyers have been arguing that the Morales testimony was flawed because the prosecutors did not reveal that he had cooperated with them in previous cases. During the trial, Morales said he did not know how to confide in law enforcement even though he had in the past. Prosecutors put a lot of confidence in that testimony because there was no physical evidence that connected Guandique to Levy's death.", "question": "A US judge has @placeholder granted a retrial in the case of murdered intern Chandra Levy , who disappeared in 2001 .", "option_0": "already", "option_1": "formally", "option_2": "not", "option_3": "reportedly", "option_4": "briefly", "label": 1}

Charteris has played for Perpignan, Racing 92 and Bath in four and a half seasons outside Wales. \"I've spoken to Sanj [Williams] about it and for him I think it would be a great move,\" said Charteris. \"He would be playing in an unbelievable team, playing in a great league in the Premiership and he will flourish as a player and go from strength to strength.\" Williams and Charteris line up for Wales against South Africa in Cardiff on Saturday in the final match of Wales' autumn series. Scarlets and the Welsh Rugby Union are keen to keep the player in Wales. A move to England would mean Williams - who plays full-back for his region - would be subject to rules which limit the number of players based outside Wales who can be picked for the national side. The senior player selection policy - known as the so-called \"Gatland's law\" - means only three wildcard players can be in the Wales squad for any series of matches. This autumn Jamie Roberts (Harlequins), George North (Northampton) and Taulupe Faletau (Bath) were the selections with Bath fly-half Rhys Priestland missing out. Charteris is exempt because he was not offered a contract by a Welsh region before joining Bath, but still believes Saracens would be a good move for Williams. \"I understand the argument from Wales why they want to keep players here but from a purely selfish point of view - or from a player's point of view - I think it's undoubtedly the right move and the best thing for him to do,\" added Charteris. \"And I think Wales as a national team will benefit from that because he will come back with more experience. He will learn things from Saracens, little things that he can bring back. \"I certainly do understand the argument of having the best players in Wales in terms of selling it to the public. \"But I think the fact we only have four teams means we have to have some boys playing away to open up spots for other players.\" Charteris left Newport Gwent Dragons for Perpignan in 2012 and says the move had been a big success for him. \"It's a hard one - it's all about the individual,\" he added. \"For me it was the best thing I ever did was move outside of Wales. \"From a personal point of view, for my private life, for my family, for all of that it was brilliant. \"I've loved it.

Three quarters of those in the research said information in the adverts was too complicated to make an easy comparison. In particular, line rental costs were often not included in the advertised headline cost. Earlier this year, Citizens Advice said that teaser deals in adverts were masking the long-term cost of broadband packages. Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the continuing problem with broadband adverts meant that potential customers were often left unable to make an informed decision. \"Attractive headline offers that don't include line rental costs make it impossible for people to work out the best broadband deal on offer without doing complicated sums,\" she said. \"Broadband providers need to make the costs of a contract clear in their advertising and  the Advertising Standards Authority should also review the code of practice to make sure it  works well for consumers.\" In its latest research, Citizens Advice took a sample of just over 2,000 adults and split them into four groups. Eight adverts, produced by seven unidentified companies, were selected by the charity and divided into four pairs. Each of the four groups of people were then asked to compare a different pair of adverts, and also to look at marketing information on the websites of the companies involved. The research found that 56% of those involved could not work out the cost of the deals on offer, and thus were unable to decide which was cheapest. One advert, which the charity declined to identify, was so bad that only 22% of people in the research could work out accurately how much the deal on offer might cost them. The charity said the source of the problem lay in the prominence given to temporary \"teaser\" rates, while at the same time the cost of line rental was often downplayed. \"The adverts typically are advertised with a promotional period featured prominently, which can be free or significantly lower than the overall cost of the contract,\" said Citizens Advice. \"The cost of line rental and the length of time that the 'teaser' price applies is included separately and often only in small print,\" it explained.

She was injured while reporting from the rebel-held northern region of Sri Lanka in 2001 and lost the sight in her left eye. Speaking in 2010 at a service remembering journalists killed in conflict, she said that war reporting must continue, despite the dangers. \"Our mission is to report these horrors of war with accuracy and without prejudice,\" she said. \"We always have to ask ourselves whether the level of risk is worth the story.\" Marie Colvin, who was 56 and a Yale graduate, was known for her personal style of war reporting and had frequently been the lone journalist in areas of high risk. She won many awards for her work, including Foreign Reporter of the Year at the British Press Awards in 2010. Paying tribute to Marie Colvin, the editor of the Sunday Times, John Witherow, said she was an \"extraordinary figure\" in the life of the paper, driven by a passion to cover wars in the belief that what she did mattered. Her thoughts were always with the victims of violence, he said. He added that she was a woman with \"a tremendous joie de vivre, full of humour and mischief and surrounded by a large circle of friends, all of whom feared the consequences of her bravery\". Marie Colvin's report from Homsappeared on the front page of the most recent edition of the Sunday Times. Referring to the article in an email to the BBC's Middle East Editor, Jeremy Bowen, on Monday night, Marie Colvin wrote that she thought the piece \"was one of those we got into journalism for\". \"They are killing with impunity here, it is sickening and anger-making,\" she wrote. Writing to a friend on Facebook the night before she was killed, she joked that reports of her survival \"may be exaggerated\". She said of Baba Amr that she could not understand \"how the world can stand by and I should be hardened by now. \"Feeling helpless. As well as cold! Will keep trying to get out the information.\" Her mother told journalists Ms Colvin's legacy was: \"Be passionate and be involved in what you believe in.

Highland Council has raised concerns about the loss of local knowledge once the Inverness service shuts. Council leader Margaret Davidson said the local authority \"was convinced that it was safer\" that calls from within Highland, a region about the same size of Belgium, were handled locally. Ch Supt Spiers told BBC Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that Police Scotland acknowledged that were concerns about the restructuring. But he said the current set-up of call handling was not \"practical or sustainable\" for a national force, and its change programme would be carried out with due regard to proper \"governance, measures and independent assurances\". Control rooms in Inverness and Aberdeen were originally scheduled for closure in 2015. However, that original closure plan was halted after an HM Inspector of Constabulary (HMIC) investigation began into a crash on the M9 in July which was not followed up by police for three days.

And more than a third of almost 3,000 UK students surveyed said they were interested in studying abroad. Rebecca Hughes, British Council director of education, said barriers were \"gradually diminishing\". The British Council, which promotes UK culture and education overseas, says interest among UK students in working and studying abroad is growing. Last year, 15,566 UK students took part in the European Union's Erasmus programme, spending up to a year in another European country as part of their degrees. This was 115% up on the number who took part when the programme began in the UK in 2007 and a rise of 6.8% on the year before. More than 7,000 students also went to work or study in China last year on British Council Generation UK China scholarships, up from 6,000 the year before. And more than 2,500 have applied for 500 places on the Generation UK India programme, launched this year. The figures are published ahead of the British Council's Going Global international higher education conference in London next week. Of 2,856 UK students interviewed for the report, 34% said they were interested in overseas study. Almost half (48%) of these said they were most attracted by the chance to travel and explore different cultures, 30% said they hoped ultimately to work for an international company and live overseas, while 15% wanted to access the best universities for their subject. Only 7% said they wanted to return home as soon as possible once their period of overseas study was finished. Of those who had already studied abroad, 40% defined the main advantage as a boost to their career chances, while 60% said it had given them experience of another culture and the chance to travel. The most popular option was to study abroad for a year as an undergraduate. The United States was the most desired destination but 42% preferred non-English-speaking countries. One of the biggest deterrents was a perceived lack of language skills, the study suggests, along with cost. Help with foreign language training and funding were popular suggested solutions. \"This latest evidence confirms that a growing number of the UK's students are recognising the huge value to be gained from international experience,\" said Prof Hughes. \"Our universities play an important role in supporting those ambitions.

The Welsh Government has set out mitigation works for the scheme. In evidence to the public inquiry in Newport on Wednesday, CPRW chairman Peter Ogden said the road would cause \"irreversible damage\" to distinctive landscapes. The Welsh Government's preferred route - known as the \"black route\" - cuts across the Gwent Levels and four Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). He said the government study given to the inquiry underestimated the impact of the motorway on the \"undisturbed character and tranquil nature\" of the area. A combination of lighting, traffic volumes and a proposed bridge crossing the River Usk, would create \"unacceptable change\" and \"clutter\" to the Gwent Levels, he said. The landscapes of Wales were \"finite resources\" and had been shaped over hundreds, if not thousands of years, he added. Mr Ogden accused the Welsh Government of breaching its own national policies with the proposals, including the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act.

{"article": "The underground volcanic structures have previously been proposed as ideal sites for human settlements. Scientists have now assessed how stable these features might be, and found that tubes of 1km in size and bigger would be structurally sound. They could protect against the challenges posed by the lunar environment. Details of the work were presented at the 46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC) in Texas. Unlike Earth, the Moon lacks a thick atmosphere and magnetic field to protect it against cosmic radiation. The absence of an atmospheric buffer also means that the Moon's surface receives more frequent meteorite impacts and more extremes of temperature. For example, the Moon's surface temperature can vary by several hundred degrees C during the course of a lunar day. But housing bases underground, inside lava tubes, could offer shielding against these risks. The lunar tunnels are expected to be larger than those already discovered on our planet, because of the Moon's lower gravity. No-one has yet definitively discovered an example on the Moon, but spacecraft have revealed cave entrances called skylights that may open into lava tubes. Using existing data, David Blair and colleagues from Purdue University in West Lafayette used computer modelling to determine the stability of lunar lava tubes with different widths, roof shapes and roof thicknesses. \"It's the first modern re-assessment of how stable these can be,\" he told BBC News. He found that tunnels with widths of 1km and greater could remain standing beneath the lunar surface. In his poster at the meeting, he displayed a diagram showing his home town of Philadelphia sitting neatly within a lava tube with a width of 5km - which was found to be the rough theoretical maximum for stability. The underground structures are thought to have been formed during basaltic lava flows during the Moon's history. When the upper layer of a lava flow cools and hardens, molten rock may continue to flow beneath it. Once this drains, it can leave behind a hollow space. Long, snaking features on the Moon called sinuous rilles are thought by some to be lava tubes that have collapsed in on themselves. However, this interpretation is controversial among scientists.

It has consistently denied targeting civilians. Russia's aerial intervention in the Syrian conflict last year has helped the Syrian army capture eastern Aleppo. But it has further heightened tensions with the West, after it annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014. Aleppo evacuation nears its end Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said 162 types of modern armaments had been tested during the campaign in Syria, which included 18,800 aerial sorties. \"What we see in Syria of course is a demonstration of capabilities and using weapons that are not necessary,\" Gen Hodges told the BBC. President-elect Donald Trump is known to want better relations with Moscow, but Gen Hodges said the US military was pushing ahead with plans to bolster its presence in Europe. \"All the indications show we are going to continue our commitment,\" he said. President Vladimir Putin gave a bullish account on Thursday of Russia's military strength at the defence ministry's final meeting of 2016, describing it as \"currently stronger than any potential aggressor\". But he said Russia had to \"strengthen the military potential of strategic nuclear forces, especially with missile complexes that can reliably penetrate any existing and prospective missile defence systems\". Mr Shoigu accused Nato of doubling the intensity of its military exercises, mainly with the focus on Russia. He singled out the UK, accusing British armed forces of using Russian tanks and army uniforms to identify the enemy during exercises on Salisbury Plain in southern England. \"The last time this way of training troops was used was by Nazi Germany,\" he added.", "question": "The US army 's commander in Europe has accused Russia of using its military campaign in Syria as a \" live - fire training @placeholder \" .", "option_0": "opportunity", "option_1": "tool", "option_2": "mission", "option_3": "purpose", "option_4": "facility", "label": 0}

The Marvel release becomes the first film of the year to pass that milestone, while its box office takings around the world have reached the $600m (£370m) mark. Another notable new entry in the rundown is The Drop, starring the late James Gandolfini and British actor Tom Hardy, which landed in sixth spot after opening in a limited number of cinemas. No Good Deed, which co-stars Taraji P Henson as a woman terrorised by Elba's character, was hailed as a success by makers Sony, who marketed the film heavily prior to release. \"It's a movie that we really loved and felt that it was going to win,\" said Rory Bauer, the company's head of distribution.

{"article": "Barack Obama's social media strategy in 2012 was hailed a success and Hilary Clinton announced her bid for the US presidency amid online fanfare. But how effectively is Welsh politics harnessing digital power? Expert Paul Shepherd described social media campaigning by the major Welsh political parties as \"primitive\". \"It's active, engaging in places, but there is so much more that could be done by analysing social media data and reacting to the wealth of information held within,\" said Mr Shepherd, chief executive of social media agency, Coup Media. He said it reflected most of the digital campaigning across the UK, adding: \"It's disappointing because the tools and skill sets are now available to really drill down into what people think and react accordingly.\" Plaid Cymru has garnered 16,400 Twitter followers and 15,244 \"likes\" on Facebook - the most received by any Welsh party. Mr Shepherd, whose company has offices in Newport and London, said the party had partly taken \"the humorous route\". One of its promotional videos, which has been viewed more than 6,000 times, begins with a young man confessing to his parents he has a personal secret. \"There is something I need to tell you,\" he says, adding after a strained pause: \"I'm voting Plaid\". Figures uncovered earlier this year showed the Conservatives were spending Â£100,000 a month on Facebook across the UK. Mr Shepherd said the Welsh Conservatives had been tactically \"good\" at breaking down video content by topic, such as those on the NHS and the Budget. However, he said the execution was \"poor\". The party has 1,598 Twitter followers and more than 5,500 Facebook \"likes\". Welsh Labour's Twitter account, which has 6,350 followers, was \"extremely active\" with a large number of responses to its posts, including celebrity endorsements from the likes of Eddie Izzard, Mr Shepherd observed. Its Facebook page has 1,482 \"likes\". However, a Labour advert starring The Hobbit actor, Martin Freeman, had an \"unexpectedly\" low amount of views on the Welsh Labour YouTube channel. Welsh Liberal Democrats has 4,064 Twitter followers and more than 2,000 Facebook \"likes\". The party's promotional video on YouTube depicts leader, Kirsty Williams, addressing the camera, intercut with supporters giving positive comments from their doorsteps. Mr Shepherd said the party's Twitter feed was not as active as others but its Facebook page had a better mix of \"pushing policy and attacking other parties\". The Green party's Twitter account, which has 2,787 followers, is a \"lot less confrontational\" than its rivals and more focused on itself, he added. But its engagement was slightly lower, \"with re-tweets and 'Favourites' not as high as some of the other parties\". Mr Shepherd noted that the UK Independence Party's twitter account, which has under 600 followers, used \"a lot\" of re-tweets. He said this suggested the party was \"curating rather than creating content\", which could signify \"a lack of confidence in policy or just lazy Twitter strategy\". Mr Shepherd urged the parties to pay more attention to the way the public interacted with their online content. \"It's all a huge source of intelligence that, when treated correctly, can give you the insights that will give the edge over the competition,\" he added. \"It also shows the electorate that you're doing the most important thing - listening.\" Elizabeth Linder, politics and government specialist of Facebook UK, said last month social media would be \"absolutely at the heart\" of political campaigning across the UK.", "question": "Commentators have suggested the 2015 UK general election will be the first to be significantly @placeholder by websites like Facebook , Twitter and YouTube .", "option_0": "provoked", "option_1": "determined", "option_2": "supported", "option_3": "targeted", "option_4": "overseen", "label": 1}

The book, Meme Le Silence A Une Fin (Even Silence Has An End), is released on Tuesday in several countries. It has caused a row in Colombia over what she wrote about fellow captives. In the book, Ms Betancourt recalls how Farc (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) gunmen seized her in southern Colombia as she campaigned for the presidency in February 2002. She reveals that it was at times very difficult to keep hopes alive in the hostile jungle. \"We were handed the heaviest sentence a human being can be given, that of not knowing when it would end,\" she writes in the book, the AFP news agency reports. She also writes of tensions with her former campaign manager, Clara Rojas, who was captured at the same time as her and with whom she shared a cage. \"You had to be very strong not to find relief from the guards' constant humiliations by in turn humiliating the person who shares your fate.\" Ms Rojas described some of Ms Betancourt's comments about Ms Rojas's decision to remain pregnant while in captivity in the book as \"vile\". Ms Rojas gave birth to a boy, fathered by one of the rebels, while being held hostage and was reunited with her child after she was freed in January 2008. Some of Ms Betancourt's fellow hostages have already written unflattering accounts of being held captive with her. Ms Betancourt, who also has French nationality, admits that she had a \"fear of being alone. Fear of fear. Fear of dying\".

The initial accident was apparently reported but not followed up by police. On Tuesday, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland published a report into call handling by Police Scotland in the aftermath of that incident. The report made 30 recommendations to improve the system. But it was emphasised that Tuesday's report did not investigate police action with regard to the specific case on the M9. That task falls to the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner. Which resulted in the disjuncture at Holyrood today. Labour's Kezia Dugdale and the Conservatives' Ruth Davidson both pursued the first minister. Ms Dugdale said Tuesday's report amounted to a \"damning assessment\" of the Scottish government in that it was ministers who conjoined Scotland's forces into Police Scotland. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she was ducking nothing. All 30 recommendations had been accepted. All 30 recommendations would be implemented. But the report, she stressed, said nothing about the tragic events on the M9. She offered sympathy to the families involved, as did others. But were Scottish Ministers generically culpable? Both Ms Dugdale and Ms Davidson said that the establishment of Police Scotland had been mishandled. Ms Davidson went further and said that ministers were attempting, wrongly, to \"pass the buck\" onto Westminster in the shape of claims about cuts in expenditure. She said that the Scottish budget had increased in cash terms by some Â£661m while the budget for policing had reduced by Â£6m, year on year. In response, Ms Sturgeon noted that both Labour and the Conservatives had supported the introduction of a single police force. She argued that every effort had been made to smooth transition. Further, she said, one purpose of the merger had been to save money. It was not surprising, therefore, that the police line in the budget was lower. That did not mean services had been cut. Scotland's overall budget had faced a real terms cut, she said. It would have been decidedly helpful on this occasion to hear from Willie Rennie, the Liberal Democrat leader.

Now a 20-metre (60ft) high mural of Queen Bey in her flowing green veil and purple bra with blue pants has appeared in the trendy Collingwood district in Melbourne, Australia. The artist is Mark Walls, known as Lushsux on social media. He has made a name for himself by painting celebrities and politicians, including Kim Kardashian, Hillary Clinton and \"Salt Bae\" - the Turkish man whose videos of cutting meat made him a social media sensation in January. Mark Walls says he chose Beyonce to be his most recent muse because her photograph broke world records and he likes to \"paint things that normal people like\". \"Street art used to be about real counter-culture - but now that has been normalised. What used to be radical is now just mainstream and not cool. \"Beyonce is really the antithesis to what normal street art people like,\" Walls explains. But although he recognises the power of the photograph, he isn't exactly Beyonce's number one fan. \"She's not bad or anything. She is talented - wasn't she in TLC before?\" he commented. When it was pointed out that before she went solo, Beyonce actually used to sing in Destiny's Child not TLC, Wells replied that he really likes Destiny's Child too. The mural is already proving popular. Pregnant women have posted pictures of themselves posing in front of it, including Amy Jackett who is 40 weeks pregnant. Not everyone is happy though. One local resident complained that it is a \"horrendous eyesore\" that he hoped was defaced as soon as possible. But painting walls is not just a frivolous hobby for Wells, who used to work in a soft drinks factory. The paint for the Beyonce mural cost him A$8,000 (Â£4,850), and it took him five days of standing outside in the blazing summer heat. He says it's worth it. \"Whether people like it or hate it, they take photographs and discuss it. \"I enjoy laughing at some of the angry reactions\". Walls claims that he gets unique commissions as a result of the global attention, including one from the Russian Foreign Ministry. In January he tweeted a photograph of his mural of the popular meme of a fake photograph of Russian President Vladimir Putin riding a bear. Political street art is popular in Russia, and the president is already the subject of numerous murals. \"The next thing I knew after sending the tweet was a guy claiming to be in the Russian foreign ministry contacted me to ask if I would come to Russia to paint Putin. \"I want to do it - I'm now trying to make it happen\", Walls explains. Is he worried about what might happen if the mural does not meet the brief? He says he just hopes he won't meet a sticky end.", "question": "The photograph is barely two weeks old but already it feels like it has @placeholder forever .", "option_0": "gone", "option_1": "faded", "option_2": "emerged", "option_3": "existed", "option_4": "declared", "label": 3}

The attack is said to be in response to Linda's criticism of him not publicly announcing his departure from the band. The letter was sold at a US auction to an anonymous collector in Dallas. The opening paragraph makes reference to a letter Lennon received which he said made him wonder \"what middle-aged cranky Beatle fan wrote it\". He said:  \"I resisted looking at the last page to find out—I kept thinking who is it—Queenie? Stuart's mother?—Clive Epstein's wife?—Alan Williams?—What the hell—it's Linda!\" Lennon went on to respond to accusations he was \"self indulgent\" by criticising the couple for their treatment of him and Yoko. Using strong language, he said he hoped they realised the trouble \"you and the rest of my 'kind and unselfish' friends laid on Yoko and me, since we've been together\". Making direct reference to his former bandmate McCartney, Lennon questions the notion that \"today's art\" came about because of the Beatles. He wrote: \"I don't believe you're that insane - Paul - do you believe that? When you stop believing it, you might wake up!\" He also responds to the criticism that he did not publicly announce he was leaving the band, saying he was asked by Paul and former manager Allen Klein to keep quiet as it would \"hurt the Beatles\". In his last attack directed at Linda, he says he suffered because of her \"insane family/in laws\" before adding in capitals \"God Help You Out, Paul\". US auctioneers  RR Auction said it believed the letter was written around 1971 -  a year after McCartney publicly announced he was leaving the band.

However, the language from the Government is rather calmer. The former Culture Secretary,  Sajid Javid was asked on the BBC's Today programme on Radio 4 if the Government was \"going to war\" with the corporation. \"No, not at all\" was his response. \"I think there has been some over-excitement in those headlines,\" he added. The Government is not, then, publicly drawing battle lines with the BBC - but it is about to begin its 10-year review of the corporation's charter and on this topic the newspapers are far from neutral observers. In the past the newspapers and the BBC existed in largely separate spheres, but as news shifts from print to digital, the papers increasingly regard the BBC as a competitor.  Their editorial comments make it clear what they want from charter review. Rupert Murdoch's Sun says the BBC  should not 'intrude in to markets... where private firms should thrive instead.\" It is not just newspapers the Sun wants protected - the question of whether Rupert Murdoch should be allowed a complete takeover of Sky is still lurking. The Daily Telegraph comment is:  \"Why does the BBC need to have such an all-encompassing digital news operation in competition with newspapers?\" It adds that the John Whittingdale announcement  \"was billed in some quarters as David Cameron 'declaring war on the BBC'; and there are certainly many Conservatives who would like to see a reckoning for what they regard as a pro-Labour slant. One of those \"quarters\" was the newspaper's own front page. The charter renewal process is not expected to begin in earnest until the Autumn but the loyal Conservative-supporting newspapers are making very clear what they would like as a \"payback\"  - a smaller BBC. Will it happen? The trigger for the \"war on the BBC\"  headlines was the appointment of John Whittingdale. In terms of expertise, there is no-one to touch him.  He has been chairman of the Commons Culture Select Committee for nearly 10 years and has recently overseen a report on the future of the BBC. His background as political secretary to Margaret Thatcher suggests an MP with soundly Thatcherite views.  He has also been widely quoted as describing the licence fee as \"worse than the poll tax\". For those who want a radical reshaping of the BBC - perhaps even scrapping the licence fee altogether - there is a hope that John Whittingdale might be their man. But their hope might be tempered if they read the recent report from his committee on the future of the BBC.  Its conclusion was that there was at the moment \"no better alternative\" to the licence fee to fund an institution that was a \"central presence in the life of the country\". The MPs, though, were open to the idea that the BBC ought to make \"bigger, braver decisions\" about its services and  \"do less in some areas\". However, exactly what, where and how those cuts would be applied, it was leaving to the BBC. Nevertheless, the appointment of John Whittingdale and the accompanying headlines are only the beginning. Charter Review could take more than a year and the prospect of a referendum on Europe is also going to inflame passions.  Sir William Cash, a veteran critic of the European Union, was scathing of the BBC's coverage of Europe in a recent report from the Europe Scrutiny Committee. The BBC's head of news,  James Harding, expressed a deep \"reluctance\" to account for his editorial policy when he was summoned by MPs.  He did not think journalists ought to be accountable to politicians when it came to deciding how the corporation covered politics. Sir William's response was blunt. \"Accountability to Parliament must be a key factor to be considered as part of the review of the BBC Charter in 2016.\"", "question": "Does the new culture secretary pose a threat to the BBC ?

The Reverend Alan Birss said most of the gargoyles were replaced during a refurbishment in the early 1990s. He thinks that one of the stonemasons must have been having a bit of fun. Mr Birss, minister at the abbey, said that 12 medieval gargoyles which had been on the abbey for hundreds of years had to be taken down in 1991 because they had \"crumbled and were in a very bad state\". The purpose of the grotesque figures was to take rain water away from the roof in the days before down pipes. Just one of the original gargoyles was left outside the abbey to show how they would have looked, although there are medieval grotesques inside the building. Mr Birss said a stonemason from an Edinburgh firm was contracted to create the new gargoyles. \"I think it was a stonemason having a bit of fun,\" he said. \"Perhaps the film was fairly new when they were carving this and if he was thinking of an alien perhaps the alien from the film was his idea of an alien. \"I'm sure he wasn't deliberately copying the alien in the film. It was just a concept of an alien.\" Mr Birss said an internet search showed that someone had pointed out the similarity as far back as 1997. \"But it obviously did not pick up and take off then like it has now,\" he said.

It said the bans would be imposed on people who use third-party software to shoot through walls, teleport or otherwise exploit the game. The ban comes days after it imposed a similar policy on people caught cheating in its Rainbow Six Siege game. In a blogpost, Ubisoft said many regular players were \"frustrated\" by playing against gamers who enjoyed an unfair advantage by using software to cheat. It said it had taken action against cheats by deploying server software that watched how people played the game and which could interrogate their PCs to see if they were using specially written cheating programs. This had led to action being taken against 30,000 accounts with 3,800 people being kicked off The Division permanently, it said. Ubisoft added that it was scrapping initial two-week bans as this had not helped to stamp out a rash of cheating. The company had been criticised on social media for this short-term ban policy because many said it did little to properly penalise those who cheated. Few were stripped of the loot they amassed while cheating so could use it to help them in the game when the ban was lifted, said commenters on Reddit. In its blogpost, Ubisoft said it realised the short-term bans were not \"dissuasive enough\" so had decided to escalate its action to permanent bans the first time it catches \"noxious players willingly violating the rules\". Shorter bans and account suspensions would be imposed on players who exploited bugs in the game for advantage, it said. By imposing the severe penalty, Ubisoft has joined the growing number of game firms that are taking a hard line with cheats. Last month Blizzard adopted a similar policy with its Overwatch game and said it had \"zero tolerance\" for users of \"hacks, bots, or third-party software\".

Today, just hours after the PM was accused of a \"disgraceful\" tone towards those in need, calling them a 'bunch of migrants', the government has given a partial answer to its critics. There will be more cash and support for aid agencies to provide help for under 18s who are already caught up in the chaos and travelling across Europe. The government is also open to resettling more child refugees in the UK. But they have stopped short of accepting more of those who are already in Europe, maybe even just across the Channel. Instead, they are echoing the decision they took in the summer and may  allow more refugees under 18 to come here directly from the war-torn areas around Syria. Crucially, the government won't put a number on how many extra children will be allowed to come. Sources indicate that the number will not significantly increase the current commitment to resettle 20,000 refugees from the region over the next five years. There was even discussion inside government over whether the overall number should increase at all. There has been nervousness in government about the precedent it would set to take many more refugees from Europe, that could encourage more people to make the dangerous journey in the first place.

As were the viewers hoping that Martin Schulz, who is unlikely to take Mrs Merkel's crown, might at least taste victory on national TV. Angela Merkel has been in the job for 12 years, and it showed. The chancellor is not known for her skilful oratory and she doesn't relish this kind of public debate. Nevertheless, Mrs Merkel appeared relaxed, credible and experienced, effortlessly parrying her opponent's attacks. It was her best debate performance, according to the German news site Spiegel online. Which doesn't say much, given that she lost the first three. But then Martin Schulz was always going to struggle to land a blow. It is tricky, for example, to attack Mrs Merkel's refugee policy when you are on record as having said that the faith in Europe that each migrant brought with them is worth more than gold. During the election campaign, Mr Schulz has focused on social justice; a subject to which he returned on Sunday night. He spoke about unemployment, poverty. Mrs Merkel batted both away. Five million people were unemployed when she began her first term - the figure is now at two and a half million. As for poverty, Mr Schulz's own party was responsible for the Harz IV welfare reforms that shape German social policy today. Under Mr Schulz's leadership, the social democrats are promising tax cuts. But Mrs Merkel's conservatives, who have a habit of stealing the best bits of a rival campaign, are offering similar breaks. Which left foreign policy. Mr Schulz was on bullish form. Donald Trump, he said, had brought the world to the brink of disaster several times with his tweets. It was time the world sought a solution to the North Korea crisis without him, he said. And, as for Turkey, were he the German chancellor he would call off EU accession talks. Dramatic language, but Mrs Merkel could draw on years of crisis management.

The former Northamptonshire police and crime commissioner (PCC) is on trial at Southwark Crown Court. The prosecution claimed he used the information to \"aid the Conservative Party\". The court heard Mr Simmonds, of Northcote Road in Leicester, had conversations with Northamptonshire MPs Michael Ellis and Christopher Heaton-Harris about an investigation into fellow Conservative Mr Bone. Christopher Foulkes, prosecuting, said Mr Simmonds had also spoken to former Wellingborough Borough Council leader Paul Bell and the then Northampton Borough Council leader David Mackintosh about the case. The alleged offence is said to have taken place between November 2013 and May 2014. Mr Simmonds, the court heard, was copied in on a number of emails from police officers investigating Mr Bone. Mr Bone was being investigated over claims he was engaged in fraud involving the care of an elderly relative. The case against Mr Bone and his wife, Jeanette, was dropped however by the Crown Prosecution Service in 2014. Mr Foulkes told the court that during one conversation, with Paul Bell, Mr Simmonds had discussed \"what would happen in the [Conservative] party should Mr Bone be prosecuted\". He said Mr Simmonds had asked Mr Bell if he would consider standing as MP for Wellingborough if that were to happen. Mr Foulkes also told the jury about a conversation between Mr Simmonds and Mr Mackintosh. Mr Mackintosh, who was then leader of Northampton Borough Council and who later became an MP himself, called it a \"gossip conversation\". Mr Foulkes said Mr Simmonds had later told the Independent Police Complaints Commission he had been \"wearing his political hat rather than his PCC hat\" during the discussions. Mark Harries, representing Mr Simmonds, said there was no dispute his client had received the emails or that the conversations had taken place.

{"article": "The US space agency says the new wing will \"save millions of dollars annually in fuel costs, reduce airframe weight and decrease aircraft noise during take-offs and landings.\" The wing features a seamless flexible edge that can move up or down more subtly than traditional hinged flaps. The joint project involved Nasa, Air Force Research Laboratory and private tech firm FlexSys. During six months of testing, an aircraft featuring the experimental control surfaces was flown at fixed flap angles ranging from -2 degrees to 30 degrees for data collection purposes, Nasa said. But the flexible Adaptive Compliant Trailing Edge (ACTE) wing is designed to go through the full range of positions during a flight, making the operation of the wing much more like that of a bird. Making the wing seamless allows for smoother airflow, which reduces friction and so cuts fuel costs. FlexSys says its smart materials technology, which can be retrofitted to existing planes, can increase fuel efficiency by between 5% and 12%, and reduce noise on take-off and landing by up to 40%. The conventional jet wing contains ailerons, flaps, slats and air brakes, all requiring mechanical mechanisms that add weight and drag. Prof Jeff Jupp, a former technical director for aircraft manufacturer Airbus and fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, believes this kind of flexible wing would have only \"a very minor effect on improving fuel burn\" for large passenger jets. \"Mechanical trailing edge flaps are only likely to be totally replaced on smaller aircraft such as business jets,\" he told the BBC. As it is, the flexible wing is unlikely to replace the traditional wing any time soon as any new aviation technology has to go through rigorous safety testing that can take years.", "question": "Nasa has @placeholder developed a plane wing that can change shape during flight .", "option_0": "now", "option_1": "hurriedly", "option_2": "not", "option_3": "jointly", "option_4": "even", "label": 3}

In a 115-page report released on Friday, Judge Robert Atherton said the 76-year-old's application was turned down for \"his own safety\". It was \"necessary\" for him to be held at the psychiatric hospital for treatment, he added. Brady and Myra Hindley, who died in 2002, tortured and murdered five children in Greater Manchester in the 1960s. He was jailed in 1966 for three counts of murder and since 1985 has been detained at the top-security psychiatric hospital. Judge Atherton said that when Brady was last in prison \"he was much younger\". He said the mass murderer, who has been on hunger strike for several years, was \"a very difficult man to nurse\" and could be subversive and make attempts to \"split off groups of staff\". Brady has personality disorders that are anti-social and narcissistic. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1985 and his present mental condition is deemed \"complex.\" During the tribunal, Brady claimed his behaviour in 1985 was \"a charade\" and he \"feigned\" mental illness. While still in prison in 1983 he had repeatedly banged his head against a wall and the following year he added excessive salt to his food. The tribunal rejected Brady's assertion that he was not suffering from schizophrenia in 1985, when he was admitted to Ashworth Hospital in Maghull. The symptoms were \"too severe\" to be feigned and maintained over a protracted period, the report found. In 2012, Brady was \"baring his teeth and spitting\" towards charge nurse Mark Sheppard. Later, he made \"pig noises\" at an unnamed doctor. Brady was interviewed on 10 occasions since 2003 but without co-operation, \"diagnosis is difficult\", the report said. Doctors said Brady had 11 hallucinations between 2010 and 2012 \"clear evidence\" of continuing psychosis. Nurses said he \"does break his hunger strike and take food.

In his judgement, Mr Justice Charles said the court was being invited to cross the Rubicon which runs between the care of the patient on one side and euthanasia on the other. The Ministry of Justice argued that the Nicklinson case should be struck out and never have a full hearing because the law on murder was settled and it was for Parliament, not the courts, to change it.  But the judge ruled that Tony Nicklinson had an arguable case which deserved a full hearing. Judges can and do intervene in end of life decisions. In 1993 the House of Lords ruled that Tony Bland, crushed in the Hillsborough disaster, should be allowed to die through the withdrawal of feeding tubes.  He was in a persistent vegetative state after suffering severe brain damage and the judges said that it was in his best interests to be allowed to die. In 2000 judges ruled that conjoined twins being treated at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital should be separated - against the wishes of their parents - in the full knowledge that one of them would die.  In this case it was to give one of the twins a chance of life. The courts have also forced prosecutors to clarify the law surrounding suicide.   Debbie Purdy, who has multiple sclerosis, wanted to know if her husband would be prosecuted if he took her to a suicide organisation in Switzerland. Jane Nicklinson said her husband's only way of committing suicide would be to refuse food and the family did not want to go to Switzerland - and this might not even be possible. The case of Tony Nicklinson will prompt enormous sympathy.  Before his stroke he led an active life, working in Dubai as an engineer.   For more than six years he has needed constant care - an active mind locked inside a paralysed body. But many will find the case unsettling. Dr Chris Farnham, a consultant in palliative medicine, said victory for Mr Nicklinson would have damaging implications: \"It would set a precedent that would fundamentally change the relationship between patients and doctors and create an expectation that we can deliver something that within the law we currently can't  - namely to actively kill our patients.\" Mr Justice Charles said Tony Nicklinson's case raises questions of great social ethical and religious significance, issues which will now be fully aired in court later this year.", "question": "The case of Tony Nicklinson represents a fundamental @placeholder to the current law on murder and euthanasia .", "option_0": "challenge", "option_1": "decision", "option_2": "amendment", "option_3": "contribution", "option_4": "risk", "label": 0}

There had been reports that he had fallen out with the leader of the movement Mullah Omar. Rauf is a distant relative of the Governor of Nimruz province, Amir Mohammed, who said that the commander had lost a leg before being taken to Guantanamo. The governor said that IS had already attempted to recruit people in Farah, another south-western province, but had been driven out by local people with the help of the police. He said they were all the same: \"Once they fought under al-Qaeda name, then as Taliban, and now IS, they are the same people with the same programmes.\" In another sign that the Taliban are facing internal challenges, a former spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban has appeared in a video online, saying that there were several IS commanders operating, and that the Pakistani Taliban were now allied to the movement. There is no independent verification of this claim, but the video had images of several commanders across Afghanistan who were also said to be now backing IS. In the video they claim to have shifted their allegiance from the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, to the IS leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. This represents the first serious challenge to the coherence of the Taliban leadership for many years. Omar has not been seen in public since 2001. His fighters have continued their assault on Afghan military targets, even after the end of foreign combat operations at the end of 2014. And despite sustaining very heavy casualties, particularly among the police, Afghan forces have held their ground. A major ceremonial event has been held in the headquarters of the military garrison in Helmand province to tell political leaders that the Afghan forces are now in control. Huge areas of the base, called Camp Bastion by British forces, are now deserted as Afghan forces occupy only a small part of it. Commanders say that the fighting season has gone on through an unseasonably dry and mild winter in Afghanistan - but if IS does succeed in infiltrating Afghanistan, the nature of the war will change. Elders who came into the base to witness the show of military strength said that they had seen the Russians come and go, and now the British and Americans, but they hoped that Islamic State would not come. There are also accounts that a group called Khorasan has been attempting to recruit fighters in Wardak province. Khorasan is an old name for Afghanistan, and is a word that carried mythical overtones for some Muslims after an ancient prophecy that black flags would once again fly in Khorasan before the end of the world. The US said that an air strike near Aleppo in Syria last September was on a base used by a previously unknown group also called Khorasan. This group was allied to Islamic State, but it is not clear if there is any connection with the attempts to win support for Khorasan in Afghanistan. This all appears to mean that the Afghan conflict is entering a new and unstable phase. There have been more direct suicide attacks recently on civilians - including a volleyball game - which had not been Taliban targets in the past. If Mullah Omar is losing his grip and Islamic State has infiltrated the country, then it will represent the biggest challenge yet to the new government of President Ashraf Ghani, who has only now announced a cabinet after more than three months in office.", "question": "The first concrete evidence has @placeholder of attempts to recruit fighters in Afghanistan for the so - called Islamic State ( IS ) .", "option_0": "condemned", "option_1": "survived", "option_2": "agreed", "option_3": "emerged", "option_4": "promised", "label": 3}

{"article": "The year 1988 opened in the wake of the IRA bombing of Remembrance Day in Enniskillen in November 1987 when 11 people were killed. On 11 January, news broke that SDLP leader John Hume had held the first of a series of meetings with Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams. Two events later that month angered nationalists in Northern Ireland and the Irish government led by Charles J Haughey. On 25 January, British attorney general Sir Patrick Mayhew announced that 11 Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers named in the Stalker-Sampson 'shoot-to-kill' investigation would not be prosecuted. He cited reasons of \"national security\". This anger deepened when senior British police chief John Stalker claimed he had been removed from the inquiry because he had found evidence that RUC men had shot dead six unarmed republicans in County Armagh 1982 and then instigated a cover-up. On 28 January, the Court of Appeal in London rejected the Birmingham Six's appeal against their convictions. Irish ministers attacked both these decisions as a breach of the Anglo-Irish Agreement at two meetings with Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King. On 16 March, three unarmed IRA members were shot dead in Gibraltar by undercover soldiers. Their funerals in Milltown Cemetery ten days later were attacked by loyalist Michael Stone, who killed three men. The cycle of death continued. Just three days later, two undercover British soldiers inexplicably drove into the path of the west Belfast funeral procession of Kevin Brady, an IRA victim of Stone's attack. They were beaten, stripped and shot dead to universal horror. The early summer saw an escalation of IRA attacks at home and abroad. On 6 June, soldiers taking part in a fun run in Lisburn, County Antrim, were killed in an IRA explosion, and on 8 August soldiers were killed by a landmine in County Tyrone. The Ulster Volunteer Force, a loyalist paramilitary group, shot dead three Catholics in a Belfast bar in May, while a family of three was killed by an IRA bomb in Newry, County Down, that was intended for the security forces. The year saw moves by the British Government, under pressure from the MacBride Principles campaign in the United States and the Irish government, to tackle discrimination in jobs. In October 1988, London imposed a broadcasting ban on direct statements by representatives of Sinn Féin and the loyalist Ulster Defence Association.

Police arrested a man in Plumstead, south London, on 8 February. The man, 25, has been bailed pending further inquiries. The suspected fraud came to light when the art dealer, from Essex, received bank letters stating that the cards used to buy the images did not have the authorisation of the cardholders. Both payments were cancelled and refunded to the cardholders, leaving the dealer without the artworks and out of pocket. The Metropolitan Police began an investigation when, in the meantime, the suspect contacted the art dealer again in an effort to buy more Banksy artwork.

Top flight and Championship stadiums have had to be all-seater since terraces were outlawed in the aftermath of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. Safe-standing areas, featuring retractable seats, are used at Celtic and abroad, notably in Germany. Premier League chiefs have acknowledged a \"softening\" around the topic of standing clubs, with an improved atmosphere cited as one of the benefits, and clubs have agreed to hold further talks in the new year. But some clubs - including Everton - are against it and it would need government legislation to change if safe standing was introduced at stadiums in England. United contacted season-ticket holders on Thursday and included the question in a 20-point survey. Supporters were asked for the three areas of Old Trafford - the biggest club ground in the UK, with a capacity of 75,635 - that they would prefer standing to be introduced. It is believed to be the first time a Premier League club has surveyed its fans about the idea of bringing standing back to English grounds. Jon Darch, who runs the Safe Standing Roadshow, which promotes the use of rail seats, said: \"I am sure that the level of interest will be huge and look forward both to hearing the results and to seeing other Premier League clubs follow suit and ask their fans if they would also like to be formally allowed to stand at games in dedicated areas of rail seating, specifically designed for safe standing.\" The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 resulted in the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans following crushing on the terraces. There have been no standing areas at Old Trafford since 1994. Senior United officials went to Celtic Park in October to inspect the 4,000-capacity rail seating that has been used at Scotland's biggest club ground since July.

The Azerbaijani champions were no easier to contend with in the second half, though goalkeeper Ibrahim Sehic's stunning save denied Virgil van Dijk. However, Kris Commons' cross found Boyata, who headed in from six yards. A fractious night at Celtic Park but a precious victory, and a clean sheet, for Ronny Deila's team in this Champions League third qualifying round tie, ahead of next Wednesday's second leg. In the days before this match, Celtic made big play of the respect they had for the visitors, citing their impressive results in the Europa League last season and reminding their supporters that this tie could be an almighty grind. And a grind it was. Qarabag created little or nothing but in their pursuit of a cushion, Celtic toiled in the opening half. There was a lack of accuracy in their play, a lack of wit to cut open a visiting defence that was cool for the most part. Save for a tame Mackay-Steven shot and a snappy Richard Almeida free-kick that rebounded off Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon to safety, there was precious little to excite. Qarabag looked comfortable at the back. Fearless, even. More than once they played intricate passing in their own penalty area where others might have panicked. Their ease was a polar opposite to the anxiety of the home support - big in number and big in angst. That mood was only added to in the minutes before Boyata freed them from their footballing purgatory. Celtic carved out decent openings early in the second half, two of them falling to Nadir Ciftci and both of them missed. The first a header that flashed wide of Ibrahim Sehic's goal and the second thumped straight down the goalkeeper's throat. Midway through the half, Van Dijk thumped a magnificent header on Qarabag's goal only to see Sehic make a save from the Gods. Soon after, the Dutchman lashed a shot over Sehic's crossbar. Deila emptied his bench in search of inspiration. James Forrest came on for the hushed Stuart Armstrong. In a statement of intent, Leigh Griffiths, a striker, replaced Nir Biton, a holding midfielder. Then Commons appeared in place of Ciftci. And it was Commons' delivery that finally unlocked Qarabag. When Boyata stole in ahead of Sehic to score it released a pressure valve inside Celtic Park. In the process, it gave his team a vital lead on the tortuous journey to the white heat of Baku next week. Match ends, Celtic 1, FK Qarabag 0. Second Half ends, Celtic 1, FK Qarabag 0.

The advert showed a game similar to Breakout but where the bricks were replaced with single Kit Kat bars. Nestle said it was aware of the lawsuit and would defend itself \"strongly\" against the allegations. Breakout was created as a successor to \"Pong\" by Apple founders, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs. In the advert, which is titled \"Kit Kat: Breakout\", a row of people, of varying ages and appearance, share a sofa and play a video game during their work break. In the game depicted, a primitive paddle moves side-to-side to bounce a ball into a collision with the horizontal bars ranged across the top of the screen. Atari alleges that the similarity with its original game \"is so plain and blatant that Nestle cannot claim to be an 'innocent' infringer\".

In return it wants Labour to agree not to contest the Totnes seat. Dr Sarah Wollaston, Conservative MP for Totnes, described the plans as \"anti-democratic\". The Green Party said it was \"early days\" but it hoped arrangements could be made locally with the Labour Party. More on the pact story, plus more Devon and Cornwall news It follows a letter from the party's leadership to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron for similar deals around the country. Dr John Green, South Devon Green Party chairman, said: \"I think people want a Parliament elected that better represents the views of the electorate. \"I believe our voters would prefer some sort of progressive alliance that would ensure the Tories don't have a majority in the next Parliament.\" Plymouth Sutton is the most marginal seat in the South West. It is traditionally a Tory-Labour contest. The Conservative defender Oliver Colvile held on in 2015 but by just 523 votes. The Greens got more than 500 votes so the logic is pretty obvious. Arguably the perfect seat for this is St Ives in Cornwall which was Lib Dem from 1997 to the last election. There the Green vote alone, had it switched to the Lib Dems, would have seen the Lib Dem holder hold the seat. And the previous Lib Dem MP Andrew George has done lots of campaigning with the Green Party's Caroline Lucas, so there could be a perfect fit there. Mr Colvile said: \"I was the underdog in this constituency and I'm not going to try and pre-judge what would happen if there was a deal.\" Luke Pollard, Labour's election co-ordinator for the ward, said the party was \"fighting to win\" and he was not aware of any contacts for a pact with the Greens. \"I was as surprised as anyone when I heard about it,\" he said. Dr Wollaston said: \"It looks anti-democratic\" for a \"small group of people dividing this up between them\".

{"article": "There have been some high-profile cases here. Breitbart reported that a mob attacked Germany's oldest church, St Reinold's Church in Dortmund. The website has subsequently published a lengthy defence of its original article, together with an admission that it is not in fact the oldest church in Germany. I visited the church and spoke at length to locals, including a pastor who works in the city (and was named in the Breitbart report), and a local refugee support worker. They were unanimous in the view that the Breitbart report misrepresented true events in service of an anti-Islamist agenda that was divisive and unjust. In Berlin, I spoke to Anas Modamani, a 19-year-old Syrian who enjoys taking selfies. So much so that three weeks after turning up in the German capital, having come from the outskirts of Damascus via a boat trip, Turkey, Greece and Macedonia, he took a selfie with Angela Merkel, who was visiting his hostel. It promptly went viral, together with the false claim that he was a terrorist. He is now suing Facebook. Germany's political class wants to take action. Lars Klingbeil, a fast-rising star of the Social Democratic Party who is a close associate of Martin Schulz, told me his plan to tackle fake news. Perhaps Damian Collins, the Tory chairman of Parliament's culture select committee here, who has launched an inquiry into fake news, could pick up some ideas. Facebook now employs independent fact-checkers here. Correctiv is a smart outfit whose employees are mostly young. Correctiv monitors suspicious stories, looking at how much they are being liked and shared. If the headline looks suspicious, or it appears on a website known to be dubious, the Correctiv team will contact the original sources for the story, to verify if it's true or not. They then mark it true or false, and send a message to all German users of the social media platform, indicating its rectitude or otherwise. They don't accept money from Facebook, because they want to retain total editorial independence. But they too are a sign of how, outside of America, Germany is leading the fight against fake news. Read more: Based on my conversations here, there are several reasons why Germany has got ahead of the curve on this important issue. First, Mrs Merkel's refugee policy is hugely controversial, and has galvanised that part of the political spectrum that, thus far, has shown the greatest propensity for creating fake news internationally: the nationalist far-right. It turns out letting in a huge number of refugees is a good way to mobilise purveyors of fake news. Second, because of Germany's 20th Century history, there is a hyper-sensitivity about the rise of that far-right. The success of Alternative for Germany, a nationalist party, and the ever-present but low-level threat from neo-Nazi groups make many Germans determined to act fast. Third, the traditional media sector here is very different to those of Britain and America. The most influential newspapers are staid rather than raucous; the cable news channels are more BBC or CNN than Fox News, and talk radio has nothing like the oomph that is generated by the likes of Rush Limbaugh or, now on LBC, Nigel Farage. Germany's conventional media market has created an opening for fake news, which of its very nature is salacious and exciting. Fourth, there have been several high-profile cases. The Modamani case is perhaps the most notorious. Groups like the Resistance of German Patriots have been happy to spread nationalist propaganda, with a limited regard for facts. Fifth, my sense is that Germany retains a strong belief in the competence and capability of government. If there is a social problem, goes this thinking, perhaps it is capable of a political solution, by virtue of smart regulation. That was the impression Mr Klingbeil gave, but the belief that fake news should be combated by regulation is not restricted to social democrats: Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats are also putting pressure on Facebook to make it easier for users to flag suspicious content and delete posts, while those targeted by fake news would be given a right of reply. Sixth, there are local and national elections coming. Fearing a repeat of America's recent experience, where fake stories went viral and may have influenced some voters, Germany believes prevention is better than cure. And Facebook, damaged by the fallout from fake news about Donald Trump, appears to agree. Fake news is not a problem that is going to disappear soon; nor is it one that any journalist can ignore, or be neutral toward. It behoves all of us in this trade - at least those of us who retain a belief that truth is possible and necessary - to wish Germany success in this fight.

In Westminster it claimed there had been a fall of 22% between a peak in November and the end of May.

Based on average prices, anyone buying a property in Kensington and Chelsea can now expect to pay more than Â£118,000 in stamp duty alone. \"This fall-off in the top tiers of the market has cooled activity levels too,\" said Adrian Gill, director of Reed Rains and Your Move estate agents, part of the LSL group.

A wider survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) reported that the stock of houses per surveyor has fallen to its lowest level for at least 37 years. However, prices in the London suburbs - and other parts of England and Wales - continued to hit new highs, said LSL. According to its calculations, prices rose by 4.5% in the year to May, making the average cost of a home Â£277,178. That is similar to estimates by the Office for National Statistics, but much higher than figures from Halifax and Nationwide. Buyers of properties worth less than Â£937,000 now pay less in stamp duty than they used to.

Previous figures from the Land Registry have suggested that prices in the suburbs across England and Wales have been taking off, including in parts of Manchester.

This is likely to keep a lid on the number of people falling irretrievably behind on loan repayments.

Elsewhere in the UK, there was a 50% rise in individual insolvencies in Scotland over the same period, with 2,405 people going insolvent in the second quarter of the year.

Her local community raised £5,000 for the seven-year-old's school to be adapted and to create the garden. Her parents, Jodie and Phil Holden said it has changed her life. \"She's just a lot happier in herself because she can come out and it's safe,\" said Mrs Holden. \"The fact that she can come out without a mask on, without her shoes on, has made such a change it's unbelievable.\" Olivia, from Clipstone, Nottinghamshire was diagnosed with xeroderma pigmentosum two years ago, and since then has avoided the sun. XP is a rare genetic skin condition for which there is no cure. It is characterized by an extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays. UV light damages the DNA in the skin and eyes of people with XP and they are unable to repair this damage. This damage presents itself as severe sunburn, abnormal freckles and sometimes eye problems. The damage to the DNA builds up and causes cancerous cell changes, meaning that people with XP are 10,000 times more likely to develop skin cancer. The only safe time to be outside is when it is dark. Even when indoors, people with XP can be harmed by daylight coming through windows and from the UV light that is emitted by many light bulbs. Source: XP Support Group Outside her home, she has to wear several layers of clothing, a special visor over her face and sun cream is reapplied every two hours. The garden cost about £1,500, and UV filters have been installed on windows at her school using the rest of the money. Fundraisers included one of Olivia's teachers, who raised about £600 by running the New York City Marathon. A concert also raised more than £1,000. Olivia's favourite bit of the garden is the hammock where the family - including nine-year-old brother Eddie - enjoy stargazing. \"We come out most nights because it's really bright and we can get the blankets and it's snuggly.

{"article": "The voting is over and we don't have long to wait to see who will form the new Welsh Government. Regardless of who it is, there are a number of issues which are set to feature prominently in the first minister's in-tray. But what will these be? With only seven weeks separating the assembly election and the EU referendum, there will be little time to rest for a new first minister. We can expect to see the first minister back out on the campaign trail almost immediately, trying to secure the votes required to earn victory for their side. Nonetheless, the referendum is not an issue which is likely to vanish from the first minster's radar after 23 June. Whether the UK decides to remain in or leave the EU, the first minister will be eager to ensure they play a prominent part in any negotiations which follow the results; especially considering there are significant implications for devolved matters, such as agriculture and the environment. Undoubtedly, this is the issue that has attracted the most headlines during the election campaign. The first minister elected following 5 May is likely to want to get to grips with the steel crisis as soon as possible. With the UK government now getting involved in negotiations over the future of Port Talbot, a newly-elected first minister is likely to want to ensure the views of a new Welsh Government are also heard during this process. With so many jobs dependent on Tata's sites across Wales, this seems set to be an issue which will dominate the first few months of the fifth assembly. Back in the autumn of 2015, the UK Conservative government published its Draft Wales Bill, which was set to change the model of devolution in place in Wales. Following significant criticism of the bill, the then-Secretary of State for Wales, Stephen Crabb, announced in February 2016 progress of the bill would be delayed so it could undergo significant changes. With an updated version of the bill set to be published in the summer, the heated debated of last winter seems set to reignite. Wales' devolution settlement therefore appears set to become one of the primary issues facing the first minister very early on in the new term. Taxation powers are set to be devolved to Wales for the first time during the course of the next assembly. While these powers are likely to be devolved fully until 2018, the significance of this change means it is likely that taxation is set to feature prominently on the first minister's radar after 5 May. The first minister will be eager to develop an understanding of how the new system will work, and will wish to ensure Wales does not lose out financially as a result of these changes. The importance of taxation as a political issue in Wales could well be one of the defining issues of the next assembly. Health has been one of the devolved areas that has attracted most public scrutiny since the advent of devolution and this election campaign has been no different. As such, the first minister will be eager to be seen to be delivering on their party's manifesto promises during the early period of the next assembly. Given the fact health accounts for 46% of devolved expenditure, any changes made to the amount of money spent on health is sure to have a significant impact on spending in other devolved areas. Whatever the outcome following the assembly elections, the summer promises to be a busy period for whoever finds themselves lucky enough to be occupying the office of the first minister of Wales.", "question": "Steffan Evans , from Cardiff University 's Wales Governance Centre , looks at some of the issues the first minister will face after the dust @placeholder on Welsh Assembly election 2016 .", "option_0": "lost", "option_1": "confirmed", "option_2": "bowl", "option_3": "down", "option_4": "settles", "label": 4}

Since that night, owing to a hand injury, a cut eye and a career-threatening shoulder injury, Haye has twice withdrawn from fights with Tyson Fury and another date with Manuel Charr, and in 2013 announced he had been advised to retire. In advance of his comeback, he has also switched his trainer from Adam Booth to Shane McGuigan, while deciding that his former strategy to be as light as possible was flawed. \"In my old training camps, I used to come in around 15 stone - I'd lose a stone just cutting my food down,\" said Haye. \"The general consensus back then was, the lighter I am, the closer I am to cruiserweight, the faster I will be.

{"article": "Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders have been making progress on key issues since talks in Geneva began on Monday. Earlier, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said a deal on reunifying the island was \"very close\" but cautioned against hopes of a \"quick\" fix. The island's communities have been split since 1974. Key stumbling blocks to reaching a deal include the return of property to tens of thousands of Cypriots who fled their homes in 1974, and the question of whether any Turkish troops will remain in northern Cyprus after reunification. Turkey still has 30,000 troops stationed in the island's north, whose presence Greece opposes. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said discussions were \"at a critical juncture\" and that technical experts would now hold talks. Reports say the plan is for their meetings to begin on 18 January, with a focus on thorny security issues. Property: What should happen to the properties that Greek Cypriots had to abandon in 1974? Should they get the right to take their old homes back, or be compensated - and if so by how much? Security: How can the security of the Turkish Cypriots be guaranteed if Turkey's estimated 30,000 troops leave? Greek Cypriots see them as an occupying force, so should some stay or should Turkey retain the right to intervene? Who would act as a guarantor of the deal? The EU, of which Cyprus is already a member, or the UK, which has two military bases on the island? Power and the role of the EU: There is talk of a rotating presidency, but how would that work? And could a Turkish Cypriot president really represent the country from time-to-time at EU summits? Territory: How much more territory should Greek Cypriots gain to reflect the fact that they make up the majority of the island's population? UN peacekeeping forces estimate that 165,000 Greek Cypriots fled or were expelled from the north, and 45,000 Turkish Cypriots from the south, although the parties to the conflict say the figures are higher. Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias said himself, Mr Cavusoglu and UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who represent Cyprus's security guarantors - could meet again on 23 January. The end goal is for the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities to share power in a two-state federation. Any deal would have to win the support of both Cypriot communities in separate referendums.

{"article": "Three providers of Virtual Private Network (VPN) systems reported that updates to China's firewall had hindered people using their services. The providers affected are Astrill, StrongVPN and Golden Frog. Many Chinese people use VPNs to visit websites outside the country that they would not be able to reach without the aid of such tools. Sites blocked in China include services operated by web giants such as Google, Facebook and Twitter. China operates a very sophisticated net censorship system that both limits the places people can go online and what they can search for and discuss. A VPN works by setting up a dedicated, encrypted link between a person's computer and the website or service they want to use and makes spying on the data flowing across the connection difficult. Chinese state media said the blocks had been imposed \"for safety\". Reuters reported that a cybersecurity expert at a state-backed think tank said the upgrades to the nation's firewall had been carried out to preserve China's \"cyberspace sovereignty\". The renewed attempt to stifle use of VPNs comes as the ruling Communist party seeks to clamp down on corruption by top officials, Prof Xiao Qiang from Berkeley's School of Information told AP. The clampdown was \"a very clearly related fact with the amount of political rumours and information related to China's high politics showing up in websites outside of China,'' he said. The services that have been hit are almost exclusively used by individuals and are often accessed via mobile phones. China has not put any restrictions on the use of VPNs inside large corporations. Sunday Yokubaitis, president of the Golden Frog VPN service, told Reuters: \"This week's attack on VPNs that affected us and other VPN providers is more sophisticated than what we've seen in the past.\" Despite this, Golden Frog said access to some of its servers was still unimpeded.

She said it was a protest against the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, signed in Auckland on Thursday. Mr Joyce was unhurt and later took to Twitter to make a joke of the incident. Prime Minister John Key had pulled out of attending the event amid a row about New Zealand's role in the TPP. New Zealand's national day marks the 1840 signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, which made New Zealand a part of the British Empire and guaranteed rights to the indigenous Maori population, although many were not fully respected. Mr Joyce did not appear to be harmed by the missile, which hit him in the face as he was talking to reporters. Ms Butler was taken away by police, but is reportedly now out of custody with no charges laid against her. The minister himself appeared to take it in good humour, suggesting that a popular gif made of the incident be sent to the US Daily Show comedian John Oliver - known for making jokes about New Zealand - \"so we can get it over with\". The demonstration also led to numerous humorous responses on social media, with some dubbing it #dildogate. Prime ministers usually attend Waitangi Day events at the invitation of the Maori trustees of the Te Tii Marae land, on which the Waitangi Treaty was signed.

The dispute centred on the TPP, a 12-nation trade pact which has angered many Maori who say it surrenders national sovereignty that should be guaranteed by the treaty. Signing it days before Waitangi Day was also seen as insensitive. Other activists have also criticised the deal for, they say, undermining environmental, social and other protections.

{"article": "Its first verse was written for a single voice and not the grand choral opening for which it is now famous, claims Professor Jeremy Dibble. The song was written by Sir Charles Hubert Parry in 1916. It is popular with rugby union fans and has been played at the England cricket team's home test matches since 2004. According to Professor Dibble, Parry's original score said \"all available voices\" should sing the song - but only from its second verse. \"Parry wrote the first verse of Jerusalem for a lone voice, probably a soprano,\" he said. The second verse was meant to have \"everyone singing together,\" he continued, \"to reflect his desire to create a song of strength, hope and unity\". Jerusalem is one of the unofficial supporters' songs of the England rugby union team. It was also one of the three hymns sung during the Prince William and Catherine Middleton's 2011 wedding. \"People clearly enjoyed singing it together in church, at meetings and at the Last Night Of The Proms,\" said Professor Dibble. As a result, he went on, \"we've forgotten Parry's original intention of a solo beginning\". The song is based on a short poem by William Blake from the preface to his epic Milton a Poem, one of a collection of writings known as the Prophetic Books. In the most common interpretation of the poem, Blake implies that a visit of Jesus would briefly create heaven in England, in contrast to the \"dark Satanic Mills\" of the Industrial Revolution.

The UN fears for tens of thousands of civilians trapped in the fighting. The area between the city of Aleppo and the Turkish border is split between IS, rebel and government-controlled zones. A nationwide, but often violated ceasefire, between rebel and government forces, brokered by the US and Russia in February, does not include jihadist groups such as the self-styled Islamic State. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said heavy clashes had taken place inside the walls of Marea overnight between IS fighters and rebels. Marea has long been a bastion for non-jihadist rebel forces who have been fighting  President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's five-year conflict. It lies within the so-called Azaz corridor - a key rebel lifeline of supplies that links Aleppo city with the Turkish border but which has previously been severed by government and Russian air strikes. Azaz, 20km (13 miles) north of Aleppo, itself hosts tens of thousands of displaced civilians. The IS militants' offensive initially captured six villages around Azaz and took them to within a few kilometres of the city, cutting off supplies to Marea to its south. It is thought some 15,000 residents remain in Marea. The UN's refugee agency said it was deeply concerned about the plight of more than 160,000 displaced people who are massed in the north of the country. It said fleeing civilians were being caught in the crossfire of the IS offensive, and that they were struggling to get access to food, water and medical services.

{"article": "It could lead to new ways of diagnosing the condition and of testing the effectiveness of new drugs. The technology, reported in the journal Neuron, can identify inside a living brain clumps of a protein called tau that is closely linked to the disease. Alzheimer's Research UK said it was promising work. Alzheimer's disease is a problem for researchers trying to come up with a cure. The brain starts to die years before any symptoms are detected, which means drugs are probably given too late. A diagnosis of Alzheimer's cannot be made with absolute certainty until a patient has died and their brain is examined. It is also not 100% clear what is the cause of the dementia and what are just symptoms. One protein, called tau, is very closely linked to the disease, with tangles of tau thought to be one way in which brain cells are killed. The team, lead by the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Chiba, used positron emission tomography to build a 3D picture of tau in the brain. They developed a chemical that could bind to tau and then be detected during a brain scan. Tests on mice and people with suspected Alzheimer's showed the technology could detect tau. Dr Makoto Higuchi, from the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Japan, said: \"Positron emission tomography images of tau accumulation... provide robust information on brain regions developing or at risk for tau-induced neuronal death.\" The research is at an early stage, but it could eventually lead to an actual test for Alzheimer's disease. It might also allow researchers to closely follow the impact drugs that affect tau have on the brain. Another protein - beta amyloid - is also linked to Alzheimer's and can be detected in similar tests. Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"This promising early study highlights a potential new method for detecting tau - a key player in both Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia - in the living brain. \"With new drugs in development designed to target tau, scans capable of visualising the protein inside the brain could be important for assessing whether treatments in clinical trials are hitting their target. \"If this method is shown to be effective, such a scan could also be a useful aid for providing people with an accurate diagnosis, as well as for monitoring disease progression.\"", "question": "Pioneering brain imaging that can detect the build - up of @placeholder proteins linked to Alzheimer 's has been developed by Japanese scientists .", "option_0": "free", "option_1": "radical", "option_2": "destructive", "option_3": "specific", "option_4": "various", "label": 2}

{"article": "Algerian Coffee Stores in the heart of London's Soho has been trading out of the same shop since 1887 and in terms of word-of-mouth reputation, it has one of the strongest in the city. \"We don't really have to do advertising campaigns,\" explains Marisa Crocetta, 36, one of the directors at the business that has been in her family since 1948. \"You build up a reputation and being an old shop you appear in tourist guides, and of course everyone visits Soho and that's how they find you.\" While Algerian Coffee Stores obeys the first golden rule of setting up a coffee business - find a great location - it has also nailed down the second essential ingredient; keeping the regulars coming back. This it does by offering one of the best takeaway cups of coffee in London. And at just £1.20 ($1.80) for a cappuccino it's one of the cheapest, too. \"Our main business is in the bags of coffee beans, that's why our prices are so cheap for the takeaway coffee,\" Marisa explains. The shop sells around 80 different types of coffee it sources from London-based brokers with beans that come from coffee-growing regions across the globe, including Ethiopia, Colombia and Queensland, Australia. However, its most popular coffee is the espresso blend it produces in-house, a mixture of Brazilian and African beans. \"We go through about half a ton of that a week,\" says Marisa. Algerian Coffee Stores gets its names from its first owner, a Mr Hassan who was Algerian, though Algeria itself doesn't produce coffee, and the store has made a solid living for the Crocetta family over three generations - but recently it has been riding the coffee wave. There were 18,832 coffee shop outlets in the UK with a turnover of £7.2bn in 2015, according to the Allegra World Coffee Portal, and the sector outperformed the entire retail sector with sales growth of 10.7%. \"Over the past 10 years it's really taken off,\" says Marisa, adding that online sales are now a growing part of the business. \"It used to be a case of come the summer months you were twiddling your thumbs because there was hardly anyone around. But now it's consistently busy throughout the year. \"It goes from busy, to chaos to mayhem and then back down to busy again. There's never a quiet period now.\" The 10 staff in the tiny shop may have to fight for space, especially with its mail order business conducted straight from the shop counter, but Marisa says the shop is such an institution it would be foolhardy to move despite rising cost of rent in central London. \"The thing about the shop is that it's old and you can't buy that,\" she says. \"I suppose you could start up somewhere else but the shop is the essence of the business. \"It's what everyone comes to see. Everything is falling down and wobbly - or patched up.\" For relative newcomers such as Gavin Fernback, 31, who has run The Fields Beneath by Kentish Town West railway station for just three years, the secret to running a successful coffee shop is finding good staff. Even though he had worked as a barista three years prior to taking the plunge and running his own shop, nothing prepared him for how time-consuming certain small details could become. \"I still made so many mistakes at the beginning,\" he says. \"I remember looking at other places, for instance at the way they had to keep re-writing price tags because they got dirty. \"I remember thinking, 'I'll never do it that way'. But it's a bit like having children I suppose. You judge other parents before you have your own kids and then make all the same mistakes yourself.\" \"It's taken us two and a half years to get a training plan for our staff - that covers everything from how to make a good coffee to how to add salt to our dishwasher. \"If people are calling you all the time to ask you stupid questions - which aren't really stupid it's simply that you haven't shown them how to do them properly - it takes up a lot of your time. \"But you can't rush this type of thing.\" While making a good cup of coffee with the best ingredients is the bedrock of the café business, good staff, he says, can turn a good business into a great one. \"There's a roastery called Square Mile in London which has done a lot to drive quality in London and they were asked what brings people back to a coffee shop and they said on average it is 40% coffee quality and 60% service. \"If the staff are friendly and recommend bands and ask how customers' kids are, that will drive custom more than the best coffee ever served by a stone-cold face.\" Large chains such as Starbucks and Costa may have a high profile, but their brands still only represent less than half the number of coffee outlets in the UK. While Starbucks has made its name on replicating the independent coffee house experience, providing a home-away-from-home space where customers feel they can pass time, Starbucks vice president Rhys Iley says there's no getting around quality when it comes to selling coffee. \"The first thing is that you have to be really passionate about the quality of the beverages that you produce for the customers. We invest in the coffee farms so we source the best, roast the best, and then serve the best. \"If the product isn't perfect and isn't to the highest standards then people will soon see through that.\" Criticism that the chains are squeezing out independent operators in an increasingly competitive market, he says, are misplaced. \"Every statistic we see shows that the coffee market in the UK is growing every year, more and more people come into that and I think that's healthy,\" Mr Iley says. \"I relish competition because I think ultimately the customer benefits and everyone has to raise their game.\" And what advice would he give those trying muscle in on the UK's increasingly vibrant coffee scene? \"Be curious about what's happening in the coffee world, be curious about the people you want to employ, be curious about the customers and learn from them. \"In anything you do be excellent, don't accept mediocrity and surround yourself with great people.\"", "question": "If you want to @placeholder in the coffee business it helps to have been in the game for almost 130 years .", "option_0": "remain", "option_1": "succeed", "option_2": "exist", "option_3": "admire", "option_4": "ponder", "label": 1}
{"article": "Officers were forced to leave after 30 years' service under regulation A19, used by 15 forces to make savings. A police source told the BBC's Simon Hall it has \"no choice\" but to ask the government for help. The force has not commented. The Home Office said it was not in discussions with individual forces about A19. More than 1,000 former senior police officers across England and Wales are seeking compensation after being forced to retire. An employment tribunal in February 2014 decided there had been age discrimination, but police forces appealed against the ruling and judgment is expected by the end of May. The source told the BBC the sums involved in the case \"could run into tens of millions of pounds\", depending on the details of the judgment, adding it would be \"completely unaffordable given how forces have already suffered severe budget cuts\". Officers from Devon and Cornwall, Nottinghamshire, West Midlands, North Wales and South Wales took part in the legal challenge. The officers concerned tend to be among the highest paid and many would have been forced to retire aged around only 50.

{"article": "I include in that the anti-Americanism that surrounded the invasion of Iraq and the trauma of the financial crash. Dispirited. Back in 2004 and 2008 Americans were by and large united, or at the very least they were not so angrily divided. One might think that the sight of swastikas on American streets would indeed unite the country in unwavering purpose. Not so. The country is so mired in political division that even Nazi symbols have become political symbols some can live with if they feel that condemning them would give succor to their opposition. And the man running the country is actively widening that divide. There's little point parsing the rationale of President Trump's defence yesterday of the \"fine people\" who took part in the white supremacist march in Charlottesville. I doubt he himself was even trying to make a reasoned case. I suspect that rant of a press conference was driven more by his sense of personal grievance - his anger at being attacked over his initial response to Charlottesville - than by his views on race. But Mr Trump's failure to unambiguously and repeatedly condemn those far-right, racist groups gives them oxygen and strikes a blow at the heart of American identity. American prides itself on being centrist, on not having the European tendency of flirting with extremist groups. Respected veteran political commentators have often told me that the US always gravitates to the centre ground. It sure didn't look like that in Charlottesville - ask Germany, or Italy, or Spain. And if America is going to become just another country, albeit with a lot more weapons, no wonder the world is revising its opinion. Dismissive. The degree to which Americans talk about themselves as a special, unique country has often struck me as a little grandiose. You don't hear the French, or Brits, or Australians talk about themselves that way - though they may well feel it. But perhaps it takes the loss of that uniqueness to make us realise how real it was and how much the world relied on it. This summer I spent time in the UK, France and Spain. In all three countries, leaders are trying to figure out how to get by without American leadership on critical issues like climate change and trade, while the general publics increasingly see the US as a non entity. It's not even seen as a joke, people are saddened by America's diminished global status. Europeans have long had a complicated and somewhat insecure relationship with the US, part admiration, part jealousy, part irritation. But this year the reaction in Europe to America felt different. Continental Europe is feeling more confident, the economy is doing better and far right groups have been defeated at the ballot box. Even Britain's decision to withdraw from the EU doesn't get much attention - Brexit is old news in France and Germany. That newfound confidence, mixed with America's clear dysfunction, does indeed create a sense of dismissiveness. For many Europeans, indeed many foreigners, Trump is a spectacle, a reality show on steroids. But that's about the sum of Europe's interest in America right now. Mr Trump's approval ratings are slipping fast. The overwhelming majority of Americans are appalled by all that the hideous scenes in Charlottesville represent. Nothing is getting done in Congress. No wonder Americans are feeling disheartened. No wonder the world is figuring out how to get things done without their global superpower.", "question": "I 've just returned to Washington after a few weeks in Europe .

But he said he wants assurances about its future and added that the union would do everything it could to save the plant. \"There is a fair amount of pessimism about what the company plans,\" said Mr McCluskey. \"Is there a hidden agenda to close the plant? \"We want them to demonstrate that there isn't and that they're working hard for product replacement and we'll work hard with them.\" A mass meeting will be held on 1 March if the union does not hear from the company.

The Welsh Government promised Â£15m state aid on the condition 500 jobs would be secured. And on Tuesday, Economy Secretary Ken Skates told the Senedd the Welsh Government would work with all stakeholders to ensure the factory had a future. The plant currently makes 250,000 engines a year for Jaguar Land Rover and also 500,000 of Ford's own Sigma engines but it is due to stop producing both in 2018.

The first car designed under his control won three races in 2015, but Ferrari's revival has stalled this season, with no wins so far. Mattia Binotto has been promoted to chief technical officer. His previous role was as head of Formula 1 power-units. Allison, 48, was also at Ferrari as head of aerodynamics during the dominant Michael Schumacher era of 2000 to 2004, before moving back to the Renault team, where he was deputy technical director when Fernando Alonso won consecutive titles in 2005 and 2006.

This has included a restructuring of the internal workings of departments across Ferrari. Allison's next destination is yet to be decided but his reputation is such that he would be of interest to most teams. McLaren were keen to sign him at the start of 2013, but he ultimately turned them down to go back to Ferrari.

Its founder, Phra Dhammajayo, is accused of embezzling funds from the temple, but when officers attempted to search the site last June they were blocked by his supporters. The 72-year-old abbot has remained inside the temple for months, saying he is too ill to face officials. He denies the allegations and says they are politically motivated. Thousands of police and soldiers surrounded the site before dawn on Thursday, blocking the roads leading to and from the temple and putting the area under military control. \"We are sealing off the temple and after that we will search all the buildings,\" said Col Paisit Wongmaung, head of the Department of Special Investigations (DSI). \"If [the abbot] thinks he is innocent he should surrender and enter [a] judicial process,\" he said.

Age Scotland's research, compiled using freedom of information requests, found significant variations across councils in the time taken to carry out assessments. Under national guidelines, people should wait no longer than six weeks for care services to be provided after an assessment has taken place. Age Scotland found that about 10% of people were not provided with services within the six-week limit over the past three years. The charity said its research suggested that about 3,000 elderly people each year wait longer than six weeks for services to be put in place. Most councils do not record the reasons why delays occur, but many cited instances where delays were caused by the person being admitted to hospital or waiting for a place in their chosen care home. Staff shortages, financial constraints and delays in adapting homes were also cited. Age Scotland received freedom of information responses from 25 out of 32 councils.

{"article": "It has been reported by the Daily Mail that Jamal al-Harith received the payout from the UK government after being freed from captivity in 2004. The family say that figure was \"a group settlement including costs for four innocent people including Jamal\". The Daily Mail says it stands by its story. Al-Harith, who was 50 and from Manchester, was originally known as Ronald Fiddler. He took the name Jamal al-Harith when he converted to Islam, but was known most recently by the nom-de-guerre Abu-Zakariya al-Britani, given to him by so-called Islamic State. Who are Britain’s jihadists? Al-Harith was seized by American forces in Pakistan in 2001, before being sent to Guantanamo Bay - a US prison in Cuba for terrorist suspects. US interrogators found he provided useful information about the Taliban's methods, and he was released after two years. He later joined IS and blew himself up at an Iraqi army base in Mosul this week. Analysis, by Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent In the light of how he chose to end his life, the case of Jamal al-Harith is certainly embarrassing for those in government in 2004 and 2010, and for those whose job it was to assess the security threat he posed between 2004 and 2014. But his lawyer has told me that when al-Harith returned from his two years' imprisonment in Guantanamo Bay in March 2004, he had already been so extensively questioned that his interview with British special branch officers lasted just 20 minutes before charges were dropped and he was released. He was assessed - correctly at the time - of being a low security risk to the British population and he spent the next 10 years living openly in and around Manchester with his young family, showing no signs of violent extremism. At some stage, probably around 2013, he became sufficiently radicalised, or even re-radicalised, to go off to Syria to join IS. It was this that MI5 failed to pick up. In a statement, al-Harith's family said they wished \"to express their sorrow and distress at the news of his death\", but were \"concerned about the distorted and over-simplified reports they have seen in the news\". \"The Jamal they knew up until 2001 when he was taken to Guantanamo Bay would not have become involved with a despicable organisation such as so-called Islamic State. He was a peaceful and gentle person,\" it continued. \"Whatever he may or may not have done since then they believe from their own experience he was utterly changed by the physical and mental cruelty and the inhuman treatment he endured for two years at Guantanamo.\" His relatives insisted he did not receive £1m in compensation, adding: \"The family last heard from him in 2014 and have since then been desperately worried about his fate.\" Leon Jameson, al-Harith's older brother, says they last spoke two years ago on the phone, before he went to Syria. Mr Jameson described his sibling as \"fun\" when he was growing up and \"always helping other people\". When asked about his brother's suicide bombing he said: \"I can't actually commend him about it because it isn't right, but he's done it. It's something he believes in, so I'll leave that with him. \"He did what he could for other people, which is what he used to always be like.

Fury at Labour government's £1m compensation for innocent Brit\". Mr Blair said the man's release in 2004 had \"followed a Parliamentary and massive media campaign led by the Daily Mail... and strongly supported by the then Conservative Opposition\". The former PM continued: \"He was not paid compensation by my government. The compensation was agreed in 2010 by the [coalition] government...\" In response, the paper issued a statement saying Mr Blair was \"utterly wrong to accuse the Daily Mail newspaper of inaccuracy over the Ronald Fiddler story\". \"However, our sister organisation MailOnline, which is an independently edited website, did publish a misleading headline which said that Mr Blair's government was responsible for the £1m payout to Fiddler. \"This ran briefly and has since been removed and corrected.

He returns to London's O2 Arena 48 hours later knowing he must take a set off Wawrinka to ensure a semi-final place. Murray will play the Swiss third seed at 14:00 GMT on Friday. Nishikori takes on Marin Cilic in the evening session at 20:00, with the Japanese player also able to claim one of the two semi-final places from the John McEnroe Group. Murray needs to qualify for the last four to maintain his hopes of ending 2016 as the world number one, ahead of Novak Djokovic. The only way Murray can be eliminated after winning his opening two matches is with a straight-set defeat by Wawrinka, followed by a Nishikori win over Cilic. To win the group and avoid playing Djokovic in the semi-finals, Murray must either win, or lose in three sets and hope Nishikori beats Cilic in three sets. \"Obviously it's important to win matches to give yourself the best chance to go through, and 200 points for each match here is quite a lot as well,\" said Murray. Asked if he was optimistic he could recover from Wednesday's lengthy match sufficiently to challenge Wawrinka, the Scot told BBC Sport: \"I haven't thought about that. \"I'm just getting up each day and trying to give the best of what I have on that day. \"I'll just try to use a good rest day to recover.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device Having led his country to a first major tournament for 58 years, he has reason to be cheerful. Yet this picture of calm belies the turbulent journey which he has taken to this point, a path punctuated by setbacks which will make this impending crowning moment even sweeter. A centre-back who won 32 caps for Wales, Coleman's playing career was cut short by injury at the age of 32. The anguish of premature retirement was eased by an early start to life as a manager, becoming the youngest man to lead a Premier League team when he took charge of Fulham in 2003, still just 32. His tenure was largely successful, his animated touchline demeanour mirroring the combative defending which endeared him to supporters during his playing days at Craven Cottage. However, results deteriorated in his fourth full season and he was sacked. Coleman then embarked on short spells at Spanish side Real Sociedad, back in England with Coventry and then at Larissa in Greece with mixed results. After leaving Larissa, Coleman wanted to rebuild his reputation, and he would not have to wait long for his opportunity - though it arrived in tragic circumstances. The death of then Wales manager Gary Speed in November 2011 cast a shadow over an entire sport. A former captain of his country and a charismatic man who had revitalised Wales following his appointment in 2010, Speed's passing left a terrible void. It is why Coleman, on the day he was unveiled as Speed's successor in January 2012, could not hide the fact he did not want to be there. \"In an ideal world I wouldn't be sitting here because this press conference would not be taking place,\" he said at the time. \"Wales would be doing very well and one of my best friends would be with us, but that's not the case. \"I'm here for a lot of right reasons and I'm here for a lot of wrong reasons, and that doesn't really sit right with me. \"But of course I'm extremely proud to be leading my country. It's my proudest moment.\" Coleman's first appearance as Wales manager was a poignant occasion as he spoke with moving candour and eloquence. Sensitive to the delicate nature of the situation, Coleman was careful not to speak about continuing his friend's legacy, knowing he would have to forge his own path in the role. After overseeing a match against Costa Rica in tribute to Speed, Coleman lost his first four matches at the helm in earnest - the worst start by any Wales manager. The fourth defeat, a 6-1 mauling in Serbia in September 2012, was the nadir - even by the modest standards set by previous Wales sides. Just seven months into the job, Coleman was already under severe pressure, but a reprieve came in the form of a hard-fought win against Scotland. Wales trailed 1-0 in torrential Cardiff rain until two late goals from Gareth Bale - the second a spectacular long-range strike - secured victory in dramatic fashion and gave Welsh morale the lift it desperately needed. Their efforts to reach the 2014 World Cup were to end in disappointment but, finishing with a commendable draw in Belgium, there was a glimmer of hope for Coleman. The start of Euro 2016 qualifying brought renewed optimism with a relatively kind draw and a promising group of players featuring the likes of Bale, Aaron Ramsey and Ashley Williams. Yet just 45 minutes into the campaign, the scene was bleak. At half-time in their opening game away against the tiny Catalan principality of Andorra, Wales were drawing 1-1 against a side whose last competitive win came in 2004. As Coleman trudged across the pitch and headed towards the changing rooms of the 3,000-capacity Estadio Nacional, he was booed by Wales' furious fans. They had recently seen their side fail to qualify for the World Cup and the feeble 45 minutes they had just witnessed suggested Wales were about to squander another chance to secure their place at a major tournament. Embarrassment in Andorra might have cost Coleman his job but Bale proved a familiar saviour as his late free-kick snatched victory and set his country on course for what would prove to be an historic campaign. There followed a titanic home win against Belgium, then ranked second in the world, and the moment of chaotic elation as qualification was confirmed despite a 2-0 defeat away against Bosnia-Herzegovina. Wales' players celebrated wildly in the driving rain and at the heart of the melee was Coleman, soaked, exhausted but delirious with a precious sense of vindication.

Seventeen police forces across the country are looking into whether some MPs' agents should have filed costs associated with battle bus visits to their constituencies in their local expenses. The Tories said they had been campaigning \"across the country for the return of a Conservative government\" and, as a result, associated costs were regarded as national not local expenditure.

{"article": "But if the health service is to thrive in the 21st Century that will have to change. There will need to be a third pillar - the community service (or integrated care as it is known in the NHS). The term covers services aimed at people with long-term conditions. They are the patients who need care as there is no cure. Oldham's Musculoskeletal Partnership provides an integrated service for rheumatology and orthopaedic patients. It involves GPs, hospital consultants, physiotherapists, podiatrists and occupational therapy. The team sees about 10,000 patients a year with conditions such as inflammatory arthritis. It has proved so successful that rheumatology services have now been decommissioned from the local hospital, while all outpatient orthopaedics work from physiotherapy to pain management is done at the clinic. It includes diabetes patients who need their treatment regimes closely monitored and regular foot and eye checks. It also covers support and rehabilitation for the frail and vulnerable when they are released from hospital and help for people with dementia to stay independent. But the problem with the current system is that they often do not get the help they need or do not get it early enough. The result? They eventually end up in hospital more ill than they would have been. This is bad for the individual and bad for the health service - as hospital care is more expensive. Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust think-tank, says this is the crux of the issue. \"We have talked about integrated care for so long, but I think this time it will be different. \"It has to be because of the money situation. We have no choice.\" A quick look at the statistics proves this. An estimated 15 million people in England have a long-term condition - a quarter of the population. But they account for Â£7 out of every Â£10 spent on the health and care. In Grimsby most adult health and social care outside hospital is provided by Care Plus Group, a not-for-profit organisation paid for by the NHS and local authority. It provides nearly 50 services, covering everything from  community nursing to meals on wheels and drugs and alcohol support. All can be accessed via a single phone number. An example of this is the Hope Specialist Service, a community centre staffed by volunteers with support from health workers, including physios, occupational therapists and specialist nurses. It offers help for people after falls and those with lung disease so they can recover their confidence, independence and find friends. It has proved successful at keeping people out of hospital With the number of patients expected to rise in the coming years, particularly the group with multiple conditions, that is clearly unsustainable. With the right treatment, many of these patients do not need to be in hospital. But the fact remains that nearly three quarters of beds are occupied by someone with a long-term condition. The NHS Confederation recently looked at this issue, concluding there needed to be a radical rethink. Jo Webber, director of policy at the confederation, explains: \"For too long, the default setting when we think about healthcare or support is to think of a hospital. \"But in reality, acute hospitals - whether major teaching sites or local district generals - are rarely the best place for someone who needs ongoing health or treatment.\" Mike Dixon, of the NHS Alliance, which has championed the changes, agrees, arguing that by giving power to GPs the shake-up will help change the mindset of the NHS. \"We cannot carry on as we are. We are the most prolific users of hospitals in the Western world.

The death sentence was carried out after players gathered evidence about the trouble the hacker had caused.

Over the past three weeks many players of the popular multi-player game Guild Wars 2 have been complaining about the activities of a character called DarkSide. About four million copies of the game have been sold. Via a series of exploits the character was able to teleport, deal massive damage, survive co-ordinated attacks by other players and dominate player-versus-player combat.

The videos helped ArenaNet's security head Chris Cleary identify the player behind DarkSide, he said in a forum post explaining what action it had taken. Mr Cleary took over the account to carry out the punishment. The video shows DarkSide being stripped to his underwear then made to leap from a high bridge in one of the game's cities.

The ICO had been criticised for its initial investigation - which has since reopened - into data privacy breaches. The ICO said Mr McCartney \"played no part\" in the investigations. In its own statement, Google said: \"We don't comment on individual employees.\" Rob Halfon, Tory MP for Harlow, told the Guardian that the news was a \"shocking revelation\". \"Now it seems they [the ICO] have had a cosy relationship with the company they have been investigating,\" he             told the newspaper . Mr McCartney was head of data protection promotion at the ICO where he had worked,             according to his LinkedIn profile , since 2004. During this time, the ICO conducted an investigation into allegations that Google had knowingly gathered personal data while collecting photographs as part of its Street View mapping project. The ICO ruled that there had been a \"significant breach\" of the Data Protection Act, but opted not to fine the company, a decision heavily criticised by campaign group Privacy International and others. Of the 2010 investigation, deputy information commissioner David Smith told the BBC: \"We spent less time searching than others did. If we had searched for days and days we would have found more.\" It later emerged that several Google staff had been told that data was being collected, prompting the ICO to reopen its inquiries. After joining Google, Mr McCartney shared email correspondence with ICO officials discussing issues relating to the ongoing probe.

{"article": "Why haven't we seen a successful female driver? Is it because they aren't interested? Is it because they're not good enough? Is it because they haven't had the opportunity? \"Some people get the impression it's only hard for women to get into F1, but there are thousands of very talented male racers out there trying to get in and never do,\" Williams development driver Susie Wolff tells BBC Sport. She's right. Even if you are talented, there are still only 24 seats on the grid and only a handful of those - if any - become vacant each year. There is only a small percentage of aspiring girl racers - compared to the hundreds of thousands of boys - who attempt a racing career, so the chances of them getting through to F1 is always going to be remote. \"One of the main issues is that young girls have no one to aspire to growing up, whereas a young boy can grow up wanting to be Sebastian Vettel,\" said Wolff. And when a woman does get that chance, the extra focus on her achievement will provide added pressure. \"Being a female in a man's world is sometimes very tough,\" added Wolff. \"You just have to work harder. \"Do I care about what men say at the race track? No, not at all. I've always said I race for me, because I love racing. I don't race to prove a point about how well a woman can do against men on the track.\" Just as well, considering F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone's recent comments: \"If Susie's as quick in a car as she looks good out of a car, she'll be a huge asset.\" Wolff laughs it off: \"That's just Bernie being Bernie. As a racing driver, you're representing a brand and your appearance is part of your job. But there's a fine line between being feminine and creating attention on yourself because of what you're wearing. \"Sure, it's sometimes difficult when you take your helmet off to talk to your engineer and someone hands you a cap and says put this on. That's when I know I'm having a really bad hair day. \"I love reading fashion magazines, buying handbags, the usual things - but when you're in the moment and focusing on setting up the car, how you look is so irrelevant.\" While Wolff agreed that women are generally not risk-takers, she said those who want to be racing drivers break the mould. \"I'm not like other females,\" she said. \"I'm obviously different because of the path I've taken. I'm just as aggressive as the guys when I get my helmet on. Plus F1 is not just about taking risks, but knowing when to take risks and when to back off. It's also about strategy and managing your tyres.\" Many believe women lack the strength to cope with the demands of the sport, but Wolff rubbishes that claim. \"We have 30% less muscle so we have to work hard, but there's no reason why females can't get strong enough to race an F1 car,\" she said. According to Dr Riccardo Ceccarelli, who offers medical support to the Toro Rosso and Lotus F1 teams - and has set up a centre called Formula Medicine which conducts research into how an F1 driver can train to the optimum - strength is not as important as many people think. \"There is a big lack of culture in Formula 1,\" said Ceccarelli. \"Too many drivers focus on physical strength and not enough on the mental side. \"Yes, you need the strong muscles in the neck and upper body so you can have the energy to drive without any tiredness, but once you reach a certain level - there's no more benefit. There's no point putting on extra muscle. \"Endurance training, rather than weight training, then becomes key. The heart will become bigger, which pumps more blood to the brain. That in turn improves the efficiency of the brain and improves the driver's ability to perform all the tasks he needs to perform in the cockpit. Slowly, drivers are coming round to this idea but there's a still long way to go. \"To achieve the optimum in training, our research shows a driver needs to spend just 30% of their time on physical training and the other 70% on brain training. If you can train the brain to be more efficient, it's easier to multi-task and that will make the bigger difference in terms of performance.\" Wolff points to a growing number of prominent women in F1, including Frank Williams's daughter Claire Williams, who was recently promoted to the team's board. Sauber's Monisha Kaltenborn, meanwhile, was handed a third of the equity of the team by boss Peter Sauber last month and is in line to become the first female team boss while there is an increasing number of female engineers. \"These women are in the sport because they're successful, not because they want more women in the team,\" said Wolff. So even if women aren't able to match men physically, that doesn't mean they can't be successful. Endurance and mental training needs to be the focus alongside being given a competitive car and a supportive team. And until now, the latter has always been the problem. From the five women who had a chance in F1, three failed to qualify for a race - they drove cars that simply weren't good enough. Italian Giovanna Amati, for example, failed to qualify her Brabham in the three races she attempted in 1992. Later that year, Damon Hill, who would go on to win the world championship four years later, struggled to qualify - and didn't always succeed - in the same car. Media playback is not supported on this device In 1975, Lella Lombardi became the first - and as yet only - woman to score a World Championship point in the Spanish Grand Prix, or half-a-point as it turned out because the race was stopped early, when she came sixth in only her third race and went on to enter a further 14 races. Lombardi aside, four other women were given fewer than three races to adapt to the sport, but for 29-year-old Wolff, now in her seventh season in the German Touring Car series DTM, she has started on a programme with Williams which is aimed at fully preparing her for her racing debut. So when will we see a female driver be given a real chance to prove herself in an F1 race? \"Definitely within the next decade,\" said Wolff. \"There's a few of us close to F1 now.

{"article": "Duterte's landslide victory came after a campaign during which he vowed to kill 100,000 criminals in his first six months in office and told drug pushers and others: \"I'll dump all of you into Manila Bay, and fatten all the fish there.\" But, beyond the fiery rhetoric, did the people of the Philippines ever consider the human and personal cost of their new president's anti-drugs campaign? Maria sits in a wet, cobbled alleyway outside her three-room corrugated tin home in an overcrowded neighbourhood, looking at the body of her slain son as children play nearby. It's wet because it's rainy season in the Philippines. It's overcrowded because there are several thousand people in this low-income urban village in Manila. And Maria's son Ferdie is the latest victim in President Duterte's War on Drugs. The adults stay away from the wake, Maria tells me, because they're afraid. Association with Ferdie may be deadly: they don't want their sons to end up like him. This wake has lasted more than 10 days and has many more to go. Maria asks one of her daughters to fetch the undertakers' bill. It's 40,000 pesos - about $800 (£640). This is more than a year's salary for Maria. She is Ferdie's sole living parent. Her solution was to make a deal with the funeral director. She would take Ferdie's body home and he would come every week to inject it with formaldehyde and other preservatives to stave off decay. The director agreed. Maria is not the only bereaved family member currently making this deal in the Philippines. Another funeral director told me that he had made dozens of arrangements like this. They are the families of men who have been killed, either by masked men or in police stings. But, as he told Maria, this process has a shelf life - a couple of months at the most. \"What other choice do I have?\" Maria whispers. Ferdie was 23 years old and he was a good boy, she explains. He financially supported the whole family. In a country with fewer than 20 rehabilitation centres, Maria admits that Ferdie had been a regular user of Shabu. But not for pleasure. \"Stimulants like Shabu are often used by poor people to work longer and harder as well as to suppress appetites for food they often can't afford,\" says Sanho Tree, the director of the Drug Policy Project, which is part of the Institute for Policy Studies think tank. \"In countries like Thailand, for example, truck drivers or banana pickers would use meth to work through the night shift.\" When news spread in Maria's neighbourhood - or \"barangay\" - that a young man had been shot and killed by masked men, she knew it was her son. Her other children tried to reassure her that maybe it wasn't. Maybe it was another young man, they said. But she knew. She knew because the first warning had come in October - three months after the president's promise that he would \"eliminate\" drug pushers in the Philippines. Ferdie had been napping on a bench outside a shop near his home. Uniformed policemen arrived. They began to take photographs and collect fingerprints of young men in the neighbourhood. This is a routine part of the Philippines' War on Drugs. I'd seen so myself at a Swat team raid my colleagues and I had attended a few days earlier. The policemen lined up men and began registering their names on a laptop at the scene. I asked the police captain why he was documenting names. To keep the neighbourhood safe, he said. To check if any of the men had criminal warrants. Were they collecting names for any other reason, I pressed, thinking of the rumours we'd heard about \"kill lists\" in the Philippines - the chilling documenting of drug users who would later be targeted. No, was the answer. Maria says that this registering was identical to what happened to Ferdie that October day. Then, weeks later, masked men in civilian clothing arrived at Ferdie's workplace. Maria heard that they told his employers that they wanted to \"borrow him\". That was the last time he was seen alive. Maria's hands tremble as she takes a drag on her cigarette, her second in 10 minutes. Her eyes are fixed on her son's coffin, which sits in the alleyway outside the family's modest home. I can see Ferdie's heavily made-up face through the glass panel of his coffin. On top of the casket the family have placed a fried fish, some rice, tea and cigarettes. These are all of Ferdie's favourite things, his sister Clara tells me. It'll send him happily on his journey to the afterlife, she adds smiling. The War on Drugs - the terminology has now been softened to the Crackdown on Corruption - has resulted in more than 4,000 killings since President Duterte came to power in June. He took office with words that promised a purge of the use of Shabu. And people believe him. He has a proven track record, after all. Here was a man whose 20-year tenure as mayor of the city of Davao had resulted in the rapid reduction of crime. There, the so-called Davao Death Squad - a group of masked vigilantes - had overseen the killings of thousands of Shabu users. The president didn't publicly ally himself with the group. He didn't publicly condemn them, either. But, just as in Davao, there's something happening in the slums of Manila that seems inconsistent with the government's repeated assertion that they are targeting pushers or \"drug lords\". I think back to conversations with the country's Official Commission on Human Rights, as well as Human Rights Watch; that this is, in fact, less of a \"war on drugs\" and more of a \"war on the poor\". There are no official numbers yet on the type of people being targeted. The Human Rights Commission told me that, of more than 4,000 people killed in this \"war\", only 400 deaths are under investigation. And, although there have been female victims, and high-profile ones, the vast majority of those killed are men from urban slums. They are \"the country's poorest, most marginalised, most vulnerable citizens\", says Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. \"The victims have been unemployed or underemployed urban poor who eke out subsistence existences as street vendors or tricycle taxi drivers.\" Back in Maria's barangay, Clara and her brothers and sisters don't leave their mother's side. Their life, as watchmen of their brother's body, has morphed from mourning to the mundane that any routine brings. They stay by their brother's coffin and ask passing adults if they want to play a game of cards, in the hope that people will donate any of the money gambled from the card games to their brother's funeral. And their mother sits still on a bench, her eyes fixed in the middle distance, her stillness in contrast to the youthful animation that a routine extrajudicial killing hasn't extinguished.

Following complaints, BES was made to refund the customers, contributing to a record Â£2.8bn half-year loss. BES was eventually split into a \"good bank\" and a \"bad bank\" on 3 August. According to a Wall Street Journal report, Portuguese regulators are now interested in three Jersey companies, or \"Special Purpose Vehicles\", and one in the British Virgin Islands, which they say are connected to the Espirito Santo conglomerate. The companies named are Top Renda, EuroAforro Investments and Poupanca Plus Investments.

The St Helier trust provider named in the companies' filings, Sanne Fiduciary Services, has not responded to requests for comment. The filings of the three Jersey companies do show, however, that over the past ten years they bought hundreds of millions of euros worth of debt from Espirito Santo group companies. To fund this, they sold many small batches of \"preferred shares\", which are a cross between shares and bonds. These are the products which had to be refunded. Swiss bank Credit Suisse is named on the filings as the \"arranger\" of the deals. Concerns over Banco Espirito Santo, and its exposure to other companies controlled by the reclusive Espirito Santo family, first arose in June. Following the split, the \"good bank\" was part-nationalised, re-named Novo Banco, and bailed out with a Â£3.9bn loan from what remains of Portugal's financial crisis bailout fund.

The new mother-of-two has Type 1 diabetes and wore the piece of kit throughout her pregnancy to produce insulin and prevent symptoms of the disease. Three other mothers have previously given birth in Cambridge after using the device but by caesarean section.

Judge Daniel Rafecas has concluded that there was not enough evidence to pursue the charges. The accusation came from special prosecutor Alberto Nisman, who was found dead last month in his flat. Judge Rafecas said he was throwing out the case after carefully examining Mr Nisman's 350-page report. There was no proof that an agreement signed by the Argentine government with Iran in January 2013 was an attempt to shield the involvement of senior Iranian officials in the attack, the judge said. The agreement was rejected by the Iranian government two months later and was never approved by Iran's parliament. Defence Minister Agustin Rossi welcomed Judge Rafecas' ruling saying: \"We have always said that Nisman's claims had no legal basis.\" The case has dominated the Argentine press for the past six weeks, and this latest development has only driven media interest to new heights. Several commentators reflect the sense of relief the ruling is likely to have prompted inside the presidential palace. \"Rafecas has given Cristina space to breathe,\" Adrian Ventura writes in the La Nacion daily, while Clarin's Eduardo van der Kooy comments that Ms Fernandez will now be able to give her last speech to Congress on Sunday with a \"less sullied image\". But in the Buenos Aires Herald, Luciana Bertoia is more sceptical, writing \"CFK in the clear (for now)\". Noticeably absent is any comment from Ms Fernandez herself. The normally Twitter-friendly president has yet to address her 3.59 million followers about the ruling. The case against Ms Fernandez and Foreign Minister Hector Timerman is now closed. But the BBC's Wyre Davies says the judicial system in Argentina is highly politicised and the decision to cease investigations will further polarise a divided nation.

President Fernandez said Mr Nisman been fed misleading information by a rogue intelligence agent. The government has rejected any role in his death. The lower house of the Argentine Congress has meanwhile approved a bill scrapping the country's secret agency, the Intelligence Secretariat. The proposal was first announced days after Mr Nisman's death, on 18 January. A new federal investigative agency, which will be accountable to Congress, will replace it. Ms Fernandez said the change was overdue because the agency had remained largely untouched since the end of military rule in 1983.

His trophy is, however, built from stone. But Anthony is a farmer, not a stone mason by trade, nor is he trained in the skills of dry stone walling. The Omagh man took up the hobby after his family acquired a farm near Newtowncunningham in County Donegal. Dry stone walling is the process of using stones to build walls without mortar that are often seen throughout Ireland. Anthony discovered his passion after finding a large amount of stones on the Donegal land that he has farmed since 1979. Anthony told the BBC:  \"It was very, very gravelley ground on the farm. There were a lot of stones on it. \"I started, about 10 years, ago building walls. There used to be a driving range on the farm and that's why I built the walls. \"It was just a hobby, I had no experience at all.\" His farm is built on land once occupied by the manor house of the Earl of Wicklow. It was stones from this house that were used to build the walls. Several years on, and dotted throughout the farm are his masterpieces, which include a huge castle and two round towers. However, Anthony humbly points out that a trained stone mason \"would not consider it good\".

It recommended cutting councils in Wales from 22 to as few as 10. \"The uncertainty now, which has stretched on since the Williams Commission... is debilitating,\" the WLGA's chief executive told BBC Wales' Vaughan Roderick. \"And the problem that we've got is that whatever happens in the next period with any future published maps, there won't be new authorities in place until 2020,\" he said. \"That in itself will continue to cause questions about people's futures and what it means for their careers in local government.\" Public Services Minister Leighton Andrews is expected to reveal his new-look local government map this week. He will also speak at the WLGA's annual conference in Swansea on Thursday. It follows reports last week that some senior Labour council figures had asked ministers to water down plans to slash the number of authorities. Mr Thomas said some would welcome the new map, while others would contest it. But he also questioned the timing, ahead of next year's assembly elections. He added: \"The map could again change possibly. The search for a definitive map is almost the search for a holy grail within local government at the current time, and I'm not certain whatever comes out will be definitive.\" You can catch-up with the full Sunday Supplement programme for the next month on demand on the BBC's iPlayer Radio.", "question": "Uncertainty over how Welsh council maps will be redrawn is damaging staff @placeholder , the head of a body representing local authorities has said .", "option_0": "representation", "option_1": "morale", "option_2": "members", "option_3": "approval", "option_4": "issue", "label": 1}

Former soldier Mitchell, 65, pleaded guilty to raping a nine-year-old girl. He also admitted a further seven charges of indecency involving a total of five underage girls. A judge told him at the High Court in Edinburgh: \"You were repeatedly committing serious sexual crimes against young children over many years.\" John Beckett QC said: \"You deployed inducement, manipulation and threats to inflict your grossly depraved conduct on innocent children.\" The judge said statements provided by the victims made \"harrowing reading\" and added: \"In different ways you have traumatised all of your victims.\" He jailed Mitchell, formerly from Kirknewton, for a total of 10 years and 10 months and ordered he be under supervision for a further three years. First offender Mitchell was also placed on the sex offenders' register for life. The judge said that he took account of Mitchell's long Army service, his age, health problems and lack of previous offending. Mitchell abused children at Almondell Country Park, East Calder, and at Bubbles Leisure Pool in Livingston, all in the West Lothian area. Mitchell, a former classroom assistant at a West Lothian school, began preying on children in 1988 and continued up to 2004.

{"article": "Employees at the US firm's 20 global offices all have to be at work and ready to go at exactly 9.06am. At that precise time a cowbell is rung, or a gong is hit, and all workers gather for a brief stand-up meeting that lasts for between five and 10 minutes. Then the firm's programmers hit their computers, with no other meetings or distractions for the rest of the day. Pivotal's founder and chief executive Rob Mee says it is all about making the working day as efficient as possible. \"I realised that programmers, if left to their own devices, may roll in at 10am,\" he says. \"And if they haven't eaten adequately they will be hungry by 11am, so they'll stop for food, which then makes the afternoon too long. It is not very efficient. \"So we thought, 'let's provide breakfast for everyone.' It gives them a reason to get here.\" Other stories you might have missed: So all employees get a free breakfast before work starts at 9.06am. But why 9.06am? \"We thought that if we made it 9am, developers psyching themselves up for the day would think, 'well if it is 9am I'll be late,'\" says Mr Mee. \"So then we thought, 'why don't we make it 9.05am,' but that is too precise, as programmers don't like over-optimising, so we went with 9.06am. Then it became something fun.\" And at the end of the day everyone has to leave the office at 6pm sharp because staff aren't allowed to work into the evening. Mr Mee explains the reasoning: \"Programmers don't programme well if they are too tired, so we don't want them working late into the night.\" While Pivotal's approach to morning punctuality may seem endearingly nerdish, the business is in fact one of the most successful companies most people have never heard of. Valued at $2.8bn (Â£2.4bn), its investors include computer groups Dell Technologies and Microsoft, conglomerate General Electric, and car giant Ford. Pivotal's staff train the software teams of other companies - including other IT firms - to programme better. So if a company wants its software developers to up their game, to help improve a product or service, it sends them to Pivotal for an immersive boot camp that typically lasts three months. And with Pivotal's assistance much in demand, its vast client list includes BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Lockheed Martin, NBC, Bloomberg, Orange, eBay, South West Airlines, and Twitter. Even Google called on Pivotal's help back in its infancy, and Mr Mee's business also helps intelligence agencies. Pivotal's approach sees visiting workers pair up with its programmers, and then they write code together. What Mr Mee says is central to Pivotal's work is teaching \"agile software development\". By this he means software that can quickly and easily be changed and adapted, and is constantly tested to ensure it works as well as possible. \"We aim to enable companies to respond more quickly to disruption or changing consumer needs,\" says Mr Mee. Despite being raised in California's Silicon Valley, Mr Mee was late to take an interest in the industry. Not for him years of programming in his bedroom as a teenager. Instead, he only became focused on computers in his third year at university. A student at the University of California, Berkeley who had switched from medicine to Japanese, he says that one day he saw a computer program written out for the first time. \"I said to myself, 'hey, that is a language,' and I really liked languages,\" says Mr Mee. \"I looked at it and didn't really understand it, but said, 'this is what I'm going to do for the rest of my life.' \"So I started taking every computer class I could and binged on it. I practised all the time, and eventually got good at it.\" After graduating Mr Mee did three months of research work in Japan for computer giant IBM, before returning to the US and setting himself up as an independent computer consultant. Pivotal, then called Pivotal Labs, was launched in 1989, with the name suggested by his mother. Mr Mee owned and led the business until 2012 when he accepted an undisclosed all-cash deal from computer storage business EMC. He could have retired from the proceeds, but with EMC offering autonomy he stayed on as chief executive. Explaining why he sold up, Mr Mee says he has no regrets and that it was good to remove \"a lot of those pressures you carry around with you\", such as the fact his house was collateral for the lease on the office. A year later a reorganisation at EMC saw Pivotal spun out and Mr Mee replaced as its boss, only for him to get the top job back again in 2015. He says he was pleased to regain control - \"it was quite an emotional moment actually\" - but that he has no complaints about the two years he wasn't in charge. John Rymer, an IT analyst at research group Forrester, told the BBC that Pivotal was a market leader and innovator in what it offers. And in a report he co-wrote earlier this year, he said that the immersive training Pivotal offers is \"effective at establishing new skills, practices and cultural norms\".

Mr Fisher welcomed the decision but two leading MPs said the \"slap on the wrist\" was inadequate. Caroline Flint and Siobhain McDonagh said they were disappointed there had not been a full disciplinary inquiry. The appointment of Mr Fisher, an economist and former trade union official, to Mr Corbyn's inner circle caused concern among some Labour MPs who questioned statements he had made in the past. The policy adviser wrote a tweet in August 2014 appearing to endorse the Class War candidate in the Croydon South constituency rather than Labour's candidate Emily Benn. He has since apologised, insisting he had been \"misinterpreted\". Other tweets posted from his account, which has since been deleted, were critical of Labour frontbenchers while one message appeared to welcome former shadow chancellor Ed Balls losing his seat in May. A Labour Party spokeswoman said the NEC had completed its probe into Mr Fisher and that he had been \"issued with an NEC warning and his suspension has been lifted with immediate effect\". Mr Fisher said he was \"very pleased\" with the outcome and had accepted the official warning. \"I've been a Labour member for 20 years and all I've wanted is for Labour to be strong and effective - whether in government or opposition. \"I will continue to support Jeremy Corbyn... and help Labour build towards 2020.\" After he was suspended earlier this month, Mr Corbyn said Mr Fisher continued to work for him and he retained \"full confidence\" in him. But Ms Flint and Ms McDonagh said it was \"unacceptable for members to support other parties, delight in Labour MPs losing their seats or to engage in cyber-bullying\". \"The chair of this investigation has been subjected to huge pressure, and this has compromised the independence and integrity of Labour's disciplinary process,\" they said. \"Others have been excluded from our party for less than the activities of Mr Fisher.

It suggested those with \"excessively positive self-regard\" were the initial front-runners in making friends. But after early popularity, narcissism became a \"disadvantageous\" trait. For new students feeling overwhelmed by brash attention-seekers, the research offers hope that a more subtle approach will make them more likely to have friends and be popular in the long-run. The study, carried out by Dr Philip Leifeld in Glasgow and researchers in the US, Germany and the Jagiellonian University, in Krakow, Poland, looked at the dynamics of \"peer popularity\". It tracked 15 different peer groups of about 20 students from the first days of university to three months later to follow the fate of narcissists who at the outset were the centre of attention. The study, headed in Krakow by psychologist Anna Czarna, defined a narcissist as someone who had an \"excessively positive, undeserved self-regard\" and a \"constant desire for external self-affirmation\". Researchers compared the progress of the narcissists to that of students who were \"emotionally intelligent\" - and found that after a slower start, the emotionally intelligent began to gain friendships, and in a way that was more likely to last. Emotional intelligence was associated with a greater awareness of other people's emotions, showing empathy and caring for other people. Such traits were not necessarily immediately apparent - but the study found that the emotionally intelligent gradually grew in popularity, while the appeal of narcissists began to fade. A feature of narcissists was to \"denigrate\" others as a way of asserting their own position - and that as this happened they began to provoke \"significant dislike\". Dr Czarna said the project allowed researchers to examine the role of emotional behaviour in predicting popularity. \"Our results suggest that narcissism is rather disadvantageous and that emotional intelligence is rather advantageous for long-term popularity,\" the study said.", "question": "New students , in the first @placeholder days of making friends at university , are being told that being a narcissist only makes you popular in the short term .", "option_0": "powerful", "option_1": "awkward", "option_2": "annual", "option_3": "five", "option_4": "anticipated", "label": 1}

It was first awarded in 1904 as a reward to those who took part in Captain Scott's first expedition to Antarctica. Prof Nienow is a glaciologist specialising in how glaciers and ice sheets respond to climate change. His research in, and passion for, the Arctic began in 1995 with a visit to remote Ellesmere Island in the Canadian High Arctic, which has a population of just 150 people on an island almost the size of Britain. Since 2004, Prof Nienow has been on more than 10 expeditions to the Greenland Ice Sheet, firstly to undertake fieldwork to help calibrate the European Space Agency's CryoSat-2 satellite and more recently, to improve our understanding of the links between ice melt, ocean circulation and how ice masses will respond in a warming world. During the two decades he has been working in the Arctic, the ice masses there have been losing ice at an increasing rate as a result of global warming, which is amplified in the Arctic regions. Prof Nienow's work is focused on improving our understanding of the processes that are driving this ice mass loss and in enhancing our ability to predict future ice volume and thus sea-level change.

The ministry of tourism could also insist that all climbers have previous mountaineering experience. Nepal makes millions of dollars every year from the Everest industry but has been criticised for poor management. In 2014, the mountain was closed after 16 Sherpas (guides) died in an accident. And earlier this year, the climbing season was called off after a massive earthquake triggered an avalanche that killed 18 climbers. Over the past decade many people have sought to establish world records on the world's highest mountain, a practice the government wants to discourage. The youngest person to climb Mount Everest was 13 and the oldest 80. \"We don't think we should issue permits to people who cannot see or walk or who don't have arms,\" tourism department chief Govinda Karki told AFP news agency. \"Climbing Everest is not a joke... it is not a matter of discrimination. How can you climb without legs? Someone will have to carry you up. We want to make the mountains safer for everyone, so we have to insist on some rules.\" Mr Karki also said the government was considering only issuing permits to climbers who have already scaled another mountain above 6,500m (21,300ft). Over the years, Everest has attracted many climbers aiming to overcome their disabilities. Last week, Japanese mountaineer Nobukazu Kuriki, who had previously lost nine fingers to frostbite, abandoned his attempt to climb the mountain. In 2006, New Zealander Mark Inglis, who had lost both legs to frostbite, became the first double amputee to reach the 8,848m (29,029ft) summit.

He even suggested he needs make-up to cover up his ears. Mr Rubio said he saw Mr Trump applying makeup backstage, as well, because he had a \"sweat moustache\" he needed to cover up. People have been ridiculing Marco Rubio for his love of drinking water ever since he paused for a sip during his State of the Union response speech in 2013 on national television. During his remarks in Texas on Friday, Mr Trump did an extended impression of Mr Rubio gasping for air. He tossed a water bottle, sprayed the crowd with it and said \"It's Rubio!\" Mr Trump poked fun at Mr Rubio's sweating habits, calling him a \"nervous basket case\" who perspires more than anyone he had ever seen. \"It's disgusting,\" he said. \"We need somebody that doesn't have whatever it is that he's got.\" Mr Rubio ridiculed Mr Trump for a series of misspelled tweets, which he later deleted.

The lead investigator said that they \"effectively buried\" data showing that elevated levels of lead in children's' blood was tied to the water supply. The six people are all health and environmental workers. Investigators said they put \"children in the cross-hairs of drinking poison\". The majority African-American city changed the source of its water supply to the Flint River after previously receiving it from Detroit, to save money. The acidic water of Flint River corroded the city's pipes, which leached lead into the water. Several of the charges can lead to time in prison, including wilful neglect of duty, misconduct in office, and conspiracy. As well as concealing data that \"could have saved children\" from lead poisoning, employees also manipulated test results, investigators said on Friday. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette was asked what motivated these employees to allegedly conceal and falsify data. Mr Schuette said that he believed those accused \"viewed the people in Flint as expendable, as if they didn't matter\". Liane Shekter Smith, Adam Rosenthal and Patrick Cook were employees for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality; and Nancy Peeler, Corinne Miller and Robert Scott worked for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

{"article": "Every year it seems that professional sports - and, in particular, football, of both the American and English variety - grow richer, with broadcast rights, merchandise and sponsorship earning billions of dollars for the owners of top clubs, who promptly spend it on players. For quite a while, we have been told that e-sports, where audiences watch professional video games players in action, will soon rival football and basketball as a lucrative leisure industry. So far, those claims have looked overblown but this week the leading games firm Activision Blizzard outlined its audacious plan for an e-sports league which could match the NFL or the Premier League. Its weapon in this mission is Overwatch, a cartoonish shooting game, low on gore and designed to appeal to a wide audience. The first seven teams paid $20m each to enter the league and get a share of revenues from future tournaments. Activision's chief executive Bobby Kotick told us that the Overwatch community numbered 30 million worldwide, from an 18-to-35 demographic that advertisers are desperate to reach. While other e-sports franchises have relied on games and tech firms for sponsorship, he is confident that big consumer brands will want to be involved with Overwatch. Think about companies pushing back the frontiers of artificial intelligence research, and two tech giants which took on and beat humans at games come to mind. Google, with its DeepMind division which beat the best player of the Chinese game of Go, and IBM Watson, which was victorious at Jeopardy, the American TV game show, have grabbed the limelight. But Microsoft wants the world to know that it has spent 25 years on artificial intelligence research, and holds records in areas such as computer vision and instant translation, where it outsmarts humans. At an event in London where the company set out its AI vision, we heard from Microsoft's chief storyteller Steve Clayton. He told Tech Tent that this long record of research was now feeding through into products like Skype instant translation, and the facial recognition system which gives users a speedy login to their PCs. Emma Williams, whose job it is to oversee the design of its AI products, insists that Microsoft is determined to \"make the human the hero\", enabling human creativity rather than replacing us with robots. But Azeem Azhar, whose Exponential View newsletter gives an essential overview of AI developments, tells us that winning at AI is vital for Microsoft's future. He thinks it may be a winner-takes-all game, and those who fail to project themselves as having unique skills will end up with nothing. So-called sharing economy companies have expanded around the world, often focused on rapid growth rather than worrying too much about about how they fit in with local cultures and regulations.

An AirBnB host who made a racist comment to an Asian guest has been fined $5,000 - and told she must attend a course on Asian-American studies. The action was taken due to an agreement between AirBnB and a local regulator, California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device Champion fought cancer to win the world's most famous steeplechase at Aintree on his injury-plagued mount in 1981, and has been a tireless fundraiser ever since. He was given the Helen Rollason Award for outstanding achievement in the face of adversity at the 2011 BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards. \"It's absolutely amazing, a great honour. I was shocked when I heard about it,\" the 63-year-old said. Champion overcame debilitating bouts of chemotherapy and months in hospital to triumph in the gruelling National over four-and-a-half miles and 30 demanding fences, and his story was made into the movie Champions where John Hurt played his character. The jockey helped set up the Bob Champion Cancer Trust in 1983, which has since gone on to raise in excess of £12m for research into male cancers and has its own laboratory at the Royal Marsden Hospital, where he was treated. \"We initially had a few thousand pounds sent in from people who won money on the horse. There were a lot of fivers here and there,\" said Champion, who lives in Newmarket, Suffolk. \"They sent money to me care of the Royal Marsden. My doctor, Professor Sir Michael Peckham, and the horse's owner Nick Embiricos, thought it would be a good idea to set up a cancer trust. \"To go back to the hospital now and see scientists working in our research laboratory is fantastic to see. \"I had testicular cancer and was told I had a 35-40% chance of living. I thought it was a death sentence. Now the chances are 95% if it's caught early enough. \"In my time the chemotherapy was barbaric. I was sick 24 hours a day - it was awful, but now there are better anti-sickness drugs.\" In 2010, Champion raised £100,000 as he covered 17,500 miles visiting all 60 racecourses in the UK over 60 racedays. His previous efforts have included a horse ride from Buckingham Palace to Liverpool. Champion had dreamed of success in the Grand National since he was a boy watching black and white repeats of the contest on Pathe News at the cinema days after the race had been run. \"It was a race I always wanted to win. When I was in hospital some days having chemotherapy, I felt like giving up,\" he said. \"But I kept giving myself goals and thought hopefully I would get back and ride in a National. \"Aldaniti had problems with his legs and joints and always seemed to be on the injury list. He was in plaster in his stable for six months, and I was in and out of hospital for seven months. \"The vets wanted to put him down but they must have listened to me when I said he would win the National one day. What's not always been quite so well documented in Bob Champion's inspirational story is the bit that followed his riding career. Champion's raised all these millions not by sitting around waiting for donations, but by blood, sweat and tears, not so long ago completing an ambitious fund-raising walking tour of the country's racetracks. As a jockey, he was renowned for being hard and uncompromising, and in the ongoing battle against cancer, he lives up to that reputation, something that is justly recognised here. \"Maybe they gave him a chance to give me a little bit of hope in hospital. Thankfully, we got there together. \"The horse was eventually sound and he went from being an outsider to being second favourite. I suppose there was a lot of public money looking for a fairy story, and it came true.\" Trainer Josh Gifford still finds it hard to talk about the triumph without shedding a tear. \"Josh's loyalty was unbelievable. He always said the job was there when I came back. Whether he actually thought I would, I don't know,\" said Champion. \"Whenever the old horse's name comes up, he gets very emotional.\" Champion said the day after the National, when Aldaniti was paraded near Gifford's stables in Findon, West Sussex, brought the triumph home to him. \"The next day meant more to me, because thousands and thousands came to see the horse,\" he said. \"Some had travelled through the night. People came down from Scotland and one couple travelled over from France. \"That was really touching. It was the horse who did the work. I had the enjoyable bit.\" Champion's story is known all over the globe thanks to the movie. \"I was really honoured to be played by John Hurt,\" said Champion who won the Sports Personality Team of the Year award with Aldaniti 30 years ago. \"I promoted the film around the world so God knows how many people have seen it. I went to Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Tokyo and South Africa, as well as Europe.\" Champion says he is in good health despite a heart attack in March, which came exactly 10 years to the day after a previous heart scare, and does not tire of recalling his remarkable story. \"I still get emotional about it, although I might not show it.

The lawyer said the former Parachute Regiment members had no issue with being interviewed and would co-operate. He was speaking at the first public hearing of the judicial review action brought at the High Court in London by the former soldiers against the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). The issue at the heart of their application was that the men should not be arrested and interviewed in Northern Ireland, he said. A lawyer for the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland told the court \"that criminal investigations are unpleasant and unwelcome to those caught up in them but are necessary for the rule of law\". The case was described by the lord chief justice as being of \"considerable interest\" to the public. Earlier this month, the PSNI made its first arrest over the Bloody Sunday killings, questioning a former member of the Parachute Regiment. The ex-soldier was arrested in County Antrim and interviewed at a police station in Belfast before being released on bail the following day. The legal action being considered by the three judges was lodged with the High Court after their former colleague was arrested. Bloody Sunday was one of the most controversial days in Northern Ireland's history. The fatal shootings, were the subject of a 12-year public inquiry led by Lord Saville. The Saville Report, published in 2010, unequivocally blamed the army for the civilian deaths and exonerated those who were killed.

{"article": "Last winter's pressure in accident and emergency units pushed the system close to its limits and that was clear from weekly updates from the front line. A year on, there is much speculation about how the service will perform as cold snaps arrive and patient numbers increase, especially among the elderly. But now it's far more difficult to get a feel for week-by-week NHS performance in England because figures for people waiting to be treated or assessed in A&E units is no longer published every Friday. Only yesterday did we get statistics for October, let alone the first weeks in December, and they showed another downward slide below the 95% target - and below the figure for Scotland that month. Ironically, Scotland recently moved from monthly to weekly figures. Wales and Northern Ireland publish theirs monthly. There has been much criticism of NHS England with suggestions of a deliberate plan to reduce news coverage during the difficult winter weeks. The counter-argument is that weekly fluctuations can give a misleading impression of hospital performance and be unhelpful to trusts that have been subject to temporary local pressures. NHS senior management have now brought together all the performance data along with A&E on a monthly basis, including cancer treatment times that used to be quarterly. By doing that they have created a statistical \"super Thursday\" every month, allowing a broad judgement of overall performance. Yesterday's data did not make happy reading for NHS chiefs in England. Six out of seven key targets were missed - the only one met was on referral to treatment times (the proportion of patients on a waiting list for less than 18 weeks). It has been suggested that referral to treatment was only inside the target level, and by a small margin, because some trusts did not publish their data. The chances of it being breached this winter seem high so there could be a month when the headline is \"NHS in England misses all key targets\". NHS England is still publishing some weekly data and the first batch was out today, covering the week until 6 December. It amounts to an alphabet soup of stats. The key finding was that attendances at major A&E departments were lower than in the same week last year, nearly 328,000 compared with just under 345,000.  That could be weather-related. For the key indicator of emergency admissions, the latest figure is just over 90,000 but there is no comparable figure for last year. The only other figures come from the Royal College of Emergency Medicine. It carries out its own weekly survey of more than 40 hospital trusts around the UK. In the week ending 27 November, according to this exercise, fewer than 88% of patients were treated or assessed within four hours, which was lower than the previous week. This has been dismissed by NHS England as it is far from comprehensive (there are 180 hospital trusts in England alone). But it is what it is, and provides the most up-to-date snapshot available. Anecdotal reports from London hospitals, reported in the Evening Standard, suggest \"significant pressure\" at present with GPs being urged to refer only the most urgent cases to A&E units. Bed occupancy is said to be very high.  One Midlands trust acknowledged that its four-hour wait performance has been below 80% in recent weeks. The festive season may well bring additional stresses and strains, along with a possible flu impact. Twas ever thus and the NHS has got through previous winters despite forecasts of doom and gloom.

Mr Ali denies a charge of attempting to possess a chemical weapon. In encrypted chats, Mr Ali and the US agent discussed the price of a lethal dose and repeat purchases, jurors were told. Sally Howes QC, prosecuting, said the agent arranged for a harmless powder hidden inside a toy car to be sent to Mr Ali's home. A police raid in February found a computer used to access the \"dark web\" and a mobile phone which had been used to search for \"homemade poison\" and \"what poison is easily concealed?\". Records also showed he had made a payment using online currency Bitcoin days before the delivery.

The study said effective prevention measures were \"urgently needed\". The World Health Organisation estimates that there were more than 800,000 suicides worldwide in 2012. The ECNP study evaluated 2,811 patients suffering from depression, of whom 628 had previously attempted suicide. Researchers \"looked especially at the characteristics and behaviours of those who had attempted suicide\", and found that \"certain patterns recur\" before attempts. They said the risk of an attempt was \"at least 50% higher\" if a depressed patient displayed: Dr Dina Popovic, one of the report's authors, added: \"We found that 'depressive mixed states' often preceded suicide attempts. \"A depressive mixed state is where a patient is depressed, but also has symptoms of 'excitation', or mania.\" Michael Mansfield QC, whose daughter Anna took her own life earlier this year, said her death came \"out of the blue\". He said she had two children and a successful career, and no one suspected she was at risk of suicide. Speaking about the new research, he said: \"We want to know more. We want somebody to correlate all this and make sense of what seems like a senseless situation. \"So I would welcome anybody who's spent the time and bothered to assemble the pattern of behaviour because in Anna's case there was a pattern of behaviour and I for one didn't really spot it.\" Paul Farmer, of mental health charity Mind, said 6,000 UK people a year take their own lives - and \"we don't know enough about why that happens\". He said the ENCP research had an \"important message\" about the \"indicators that people should look out for\" if they are worried about someone. Factors already established included people being very withdrawn or very anxious, he said.

{"article": "Or you can be more generous to Theresa May and her government, as she and it set out a 12-week consultation, seeing this as a process of asking the most fundamental questions about what kind of country the United Kingdom intends to be. It's already been widely noted that the prime minister has broken with four decades of Conservative Party orthodoxy in saying that government should not step back. She says it should step up to support business, at least where business can \"self-organise\" to lead change. What does that mean? There are choices here. Big choices. Potentially big trade-offs. For a start, is this about government picking winners - the sectors and the businesses that could shape tomorrow? That's got a bad reputation in Britain, though it's more accepted in other countries? Is it about government standing behind ailing industries? Those, for instance, that have the strongest political lobbying power, or of particular symbolic power? The words \"industrial policy\" suggest an emphasis on manufacturing, rather than embracing a post-industrial economy. Or is it about government helping the transition from declining industries to the rising sectors of the economy, and doing so through help with re-skilling workers? These rising sectors tend to have less political clout or lobbying power. If it is about new sectors, what will this industrial policy have to say about automation and robotics, which are set to transform our understanding and expectation of work? Even if we pick the right industries for the future, they may not be the big employers. Life sciences, for instance. As Britain exits the European single market, how much can industrial policy do to build up substitution - that is, UK-produced goods and services replacing the ones imported from the EU? Or does Theresa May's government intend to expose British firms to wider international trade, emphasising exporters over substitution, however much pain that might inflict in the transition? Is this about maximising growth, and putting resource where there is the best opportunity to compete internationally? Or is industrial policy primarily a regional policy, intended to rebalance the economy away from those hotspots, to those who have found that the mighty economic forces of recent decades - and the government choices linked to them - have left more of a chill? A clue to answering that is that the policy is being launched with a UK cabinet meeting in the north of England, while ministers announce funds to improve conference facilities in Blackpool. Two Whitehall ministers are in Scotland to emphasise that, although much of this is devolved, it still applies north of the border. Whitehall does not control the skills agenda or infrastructure priorities in Scotland. What it can do is influence investment through the tax system. It already does so with targeted tax breaks for the film industry and digital games, and it has done so for 40 years of North Sea oil and gas. Energy looks like being a key sector for Scotland in this industrial policy - both hydrocarbons and renewable. And already, there's a tension between the strategic role of investing in green power and the government preference for pulling back on the cross-subsidies that help its development. The ministers' visits emphasise skills in the hospitality sector (which has depended on EU migrant workers' skills), Scotland's university science base (likewise), and a highly successful leather exporting business in Renfrewshire. The new economy? Hardly. Trading in leather goes a long way back, somewhere close to the stone age.", "question": "Industrial policy .
